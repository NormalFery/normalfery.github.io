            <div class="bodies">    
            <p>So, picture this. It's around 2015, you are a young child, playing Minecraft, and you play on 1.7.10 . One day, you make a new world, one where you can test Minecraft and see all that you can truly do there.</p>
            <p>That's me. That's what I did back on 2015. And I'm here to talk all about it!</p>
            <p>So first off, yes, 1.8 had come out already, but I actually didn't like 1.8 that much. I dunno why, but I always liked 1.7.10 much more, so I just stuck to playing it until wayyy later. Aside from that, I remember a few worlds quite fondly. First one is, of course, in 1.7.10</p>
            </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <h2>1.7.10 Memories (World 1)</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>So here's everything I remember about that world. It's been like, <b>8 years or more</b>, so I'm trying to remember everything. <br/>
                <br/>
                First off, that world was where I first learnt how to plant sugarcane, and every other seed in the game. I do remember being confused, but later on, being able to do it! <br/> <br/>
                After that, I also remember trying the command block, which was a pain because I didn't even know any commands! Talk about computer genius when I can't figure out how to use the Minecraft CLI. <br/><br/>
                I also remember building a small brick home, and a really tall, multi-story acacia tower. Acacia is like, my favourite wood, I have NO idea why, I just love it. Along with that, it had many things, and it was kind of how LukeTheNotable did his home in his... 3000 days series?... I remember seeing the first 100 days, wow. Anyway yeah, it was like that, but acacia, and with the decoration a child could make from their imagination. <br/><br/>
                Take into account this was NOT modded minecraft, so no funny furniture. I don't remember much more, but it was quite a nice world that I am so mad at myself for loosing, I'd give anything to see it again. I also remember when I first played survival, I made a small home, died to a creeper, and quit before finding diamonds.</p>

            <h2>1.9 (and Snapshot) Memories (Many worlds)</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>So it's around 2016 now, with a different laptop, and my launcher (Some cracked launcher) had the, at the time, brand new, 1.9 and it's snapshots! <br/><br/>
                Of course, I tried them! I remember trying the boat, and seeing the new blocks, and lots of stuff. I also remember making 2 separate worlds. One of them was a creative world, where I tried things like polished granite/andesite/diorite, and just did a small house! While the other one was a survival world, I remember making a big hole and living in it, going on even more!<br/><br/>
                I think I dreamed this next part, but I remember, on that survival world, running enough that I found the other, separate, creative world. They weren't in the same world, but I somehow found one of them in the other. I don't remember it well, since it was quite a while ago, but I still remember that part <b>To this day.</b><br/><br/>
                Of course I am also really upset at myself for missing that world, but trust me, if I find a way to do time travel, I will so definitively try to get those worlds and upload screenshots! Of course that'd never happen, haha.</p>

        <div class="bodies">
            <p>So, these memories are a bit scattered, and older or newer, but here's all I remember. <br/><br/>
                First off, I remember being in one of my Aunt's stores, where my dad had to do some work, and brought me along. I remember driving on the front seat and feeling like a big boy! I brought my laptop along, and with it, a modded Minecraft copy! It was on 1.6.4 , and I remember playing it, and even asking my aunt the internet key so I could connect. <br/><br/>
                It's been a long time, so no, I can't just say it, lmao. I also remember playing another 1.6.4 modpack that had a bunch of mods, along with a world I always played. And if something I didn't like happened, I'd just unzip the world and replace it. <br/><br/>
                There's also another time, when I started getting a bit of a bigger grasp on downloading mods, from, of course, non trusted sources (Minecrafteo Mainly.) and I used that a LOT back then, even taught my sister to use it! I now use only modrinth btw, but I remember downloading lots of mods from it, just to play with mods! I still remember installing Forge, with Optifine, and then a lot of mods!<br/><br/>
                 I also remember playing on 1.12.2 with Tinker's Construct, mostly curious on how it worked, but that was closer to now. That also reminds me, <br/><br/>
                 I remember, back on the sky ages (i sound old), I had a group chat with a bunch of Spanish speaking people, where we'd do voice calls and just play together. I remember making a server on 1.12.X for us to play in! It was quite fun. No I didn't doxx myself, and I did not use aternos, It didn't really exist back then, we used either Hamachi, or server.pro . I HATED that website though, but used it for far too long. God bless now I can self host haha.</p>
