<div class="bodies">
  <h2>What's this for?</h2>
  <p>My music! ^^</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Because YouTube seems like a bad place, and at least here I get to make it my own!</p>

  <h1>The actual music :</h1>
  <h2>Added by <a href="../blog%20entries/2025/blog28.html">Blog 28:</a></h2>
  <h3>Spookeez  - Fery Mix</h3>
  <p>Definitively a Mix. I don't really like it much, but it's good, better than other things</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/Spooked.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
  </audio>
  <h3>Tutorial - Fery Mix</h3>
  <p>Of course, like usual, a Tutorial mix! This one comes with a bit of improv, and more instruments, along with bongos, because who doesn't like those?</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/Tutorial.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
  </audio>
  <h3>Vs Creatives!Fery</h3>
  <p>A mostly original song? Yup! This one is a kind of "Versus Me" theme, made to try and not think much about editing videos, which I HAVE TO DO AT SOME POINT</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/VsFery.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
  </audio>

  <h3>DadFight - Fery Mix</h3>
  <p>This was, out of all 3, I think the second one I made? Most original too imo</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/DadFight.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
  </audio>
  <h3>High - Fery Mix</h3>
  <p>The first one out of it all! I've <i>always</i> wanted to do Mom mixes because god her songs scratch my brain. however my talent isn't there yet :(</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/High-FeryMix.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
  </audio>
  <h3>Lo-Fight - Fery Mix (Internally called Lo-Vibe)</h3>
  <p>A mod song? With the other two? It's more likely than you think. The latest one out of all 3!</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/Lo-Vibe.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
