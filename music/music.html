  <h2>What's this for?</h2>
  <p>My music! ^^ <br> I do music from time to time in FL Studio (Sadly not legit :( No money for that), and do these kinds of shenanigans every so often</p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>Because YouTube seems like a bad place, and at least here I get to make it my own! (And go through CSS Grid PAIN)</p>

    <h2>Spookeez - Fery Mix</h2>
    <p>Definitively a Mix. I don't really like it much, but it's good, better than other things</p>

      Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(

    <h2>Tutorial - Fery Mix</h2>
    <p>Of course, like usual, a Tutorial mix! This one comes with a bit of improv, and more instruments, along with bongos, because who doesn't like those?

    <h2>Vs Creatives!Fery</h2>
    <p>A mostly original song? Yup! This one is a kind of "Versus Me" theme, made to try and not think much about editing videos, which I HAVE TO DO AT SOME POINT
