        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <h2>I'm Fery!</h2>
        <p>I'm a 17-year-old, Spanish kid from the middle of nowhere (the Canaries) that just loves computers, programing, art, and such a lot!</p>
        <p>While my programming has been underwhelming, I have done multiple things!</p>
        <p>For example, I was the main (And mostly only) programmer for OrbitaX in CanSat!</p>
        <p>I'm also part of <a href="https://pridecraft.gay/" target="_blank">Pridecraft Studios!</a>, Mostly working in both 
            <a href="https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pridepack" target="_blank">Pridepack</a>, and my own official addon, <a href='https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pridegui' target='_blank'>PrideGUI!</a></p>
        <p>Aside from that, I don't do much more, although I do work in certain private projects.</p>

            <p>Well, I am usually in these platforms :</p>

            <h1>What have I worked on?</h1>
            <p>Besides some private Python projects that only me and my Boyfriend know about, I've worked in:</p>

            <h2>Pridepack</h2>
            <p>As of Nov 22nd 2023, I started working in Pridepack from Pridecraft Studios! It's been almost 2 years, somehow.<br><br>
            What was my first commit? Easy! The Cocoa Lesbeans! (And they <i>still</i> don't have an item texture.)<br><br>
            I was an absolute noob at git, github, and anything regarding that in general, but after a LOT of struggles...<br>
            I still suck, just a bit less.</p>
            <h2>PrideGUI</h2>
            <p>Started <i>very shortly</i> after I started working at Pridecraft, we have PrideGUI! Born on Dec 12th 2023<br><br>
            I still remember the first few days of PrideGUI and not knowing how to "gay" the UI without overgaying it. And I think we nailed it<br><br>
            I may not work on it <i>consistently</i> (aside from seeing ThinkSeal's almost constant issues for mod compat), but I still love it.<br><br>
            If everything goes well, I'll probably start working on Light Mode 2.0.0
                (AFTER I figure out what the fu(n) changes between Create Fabric & Forge for textures)</p>
            <h2>Joy (?)</h2>
            <p>So I don't really count Joy <i>that much</i> due to certain reasons, but the biggest of them all would be that... <br>
            <i>most of the code I ever did just got wiped in a refactoring process</i>, which I AM GLAD because it was
                very bad<br><br>
            Asides from that, the most I've done have been some extra Axolotl Variants (Which were added to Pridepack in 9.0 with ETF!) and some assets.
                <br><br></p>
            <h2>Minecraft Servers</h2>
            <p>This will have its own section, but I kind of want to "promote" some Minecraft Servers I work in! Specifically..</p>
            <h2>Night Zone</h2>
            <p>This originally <i>wasn't</i> mine, it was a friend's server, but after the 2nd season, I ended up being made into the owner so... yup</p>
