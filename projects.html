        <p>Well, most projects I've done are private, but I work on <a href="https://pridecraft.gay/" target="_blank">Pridecraft</a> in a kind of... weekly to monthly manner, mostly taking care of either old textures, or new textures for <a href="git.pridecraft.gay/pridepack">Pridepack</a> or either fixing small things, or adding Mod Compat in <a href="git.pridecraft.gay/pridegui">PrideGUI</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies" id="PrideGUI">
        <h2>PrideGUI</h2>
        <p>So PrideGUI is the project I like to frame the most, since it's the first big project I've worked on mostly alone (With some small help from blry), and had to do texture for all GUIs related to Minecraft.</p>
        <p>It was.... an experience. And it's not over yet!</p>
        <p>Now, Modrinth officially aproved <a href="https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pridegui" target="_blank">PrideGUI!</a>, after so long, it's finally official, and released, in it's full version 1.0.0 (No I am still not using the new versioning system)</p>
        <p>Oh yes, now there's also <b>PrideGUI Light Mode</b>, alongside Legacy and Light mode Legacy! It's been quite some time, and we're in version... 2.0.0 iirc? Regardless, we're so back</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies" id="CanSat">
        <h2>CanSat (OrbitaX)</h2>
        <p>So CanSat is a yearly school project where students make a small satellite using a small pc like a Raspberry PI or Arduino, which gets dragged up by a drone, and released. I worked as the main Python programmer, with help from another team member who wrote specialized sensor code.</p>
        <p>It was fun! And when we were starting the projects and groups, I wasn't even part of OrbitaX, I was part of "MPT", but the group fell appart and I ended up in Orbita X, honestly, I'm glad that happened.</p>
        <p>Also, I have all the code to prove I worked on it, and I have yet to publish it to GitHub, I may do it wayy later.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies" id="here">
        <h2>This website!</h2>
        <p>Yeah, I'm counting this as a project, and I have the right to! I mean, I've been working on it for some time. It deserves to be recognized</p>
