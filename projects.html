        <h1>Projects :</h1>
        <h2>What projects am I a part of?</h2>
        <p>Well, most projects I've done are private, but I work on <a href="https://pridecraft.gay/">Pridecraft</a> in a kind of... weekly to monthly manner, mostly taking care of either old textures, or new textures for <a href="git.pridecraft.gay/pridepack">Pridepack</a> or fixing small things I forgot in <a href="git.pridecraft.gay/pridegui">PrideGUI</a></p>
        <p>Oh yes, PrideGUI</p>
        <h2>PrideGUI</h2>
        <p>So PrideGUI is the project I like to frame the most, since it's the first big project I've worked on mostly alone (With some small help from blry), and had to do texture for all GUIs related to Minecraft.</p>
        <p>It was.... an experience. And it's not over yet!</p>
        <p>We're waiting on Modrinth to approve PrideGUI after blry forgot to upload images (and I made a logo) and after than, boom! Release 1.0.0 (I am NOT using the new versioning format, i hate it) done.</p>

        <h2>CanSat (OrbitaX)</h2>
        <p>So CanSat is a yearly school project where students make a small satellite using a small pc like a Raspberry PI or Arduino, which gets dragged up by a drone, and released. I worked as the main Python programmer, with help from another team member who wrote specialized sensor code.</p>
        <p>It was fun! And when we were starting the projects and groups, I wasn't even part of OrbitaX, I was part of "MPT", but the group fell appart and I ended up in Orbita X, honestly, I'm glad that happened.</p>
        <p>Also, I have all the code to prove I worked on it, and I have yet to publish it to GitHub, I may do it wayy later.</p>
