        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        
        <p>This is my webpage hosted on GitHub!</p>
        <p>I did this mostly so I can blog stuff and have a little place to write stuff outside of social media.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        
        <p>Well, I just thought it'd be fun to make webpages! It's just html though. Although, It's fun!</p>

        <h2>How many things are in here?</h2>
        <p>Well, there's this "Home page", and there's also : </p>
        <p><a href="whoami.html"> My "Who" page</a></p>
        <p>Where you can see more info about me, maybe even "blog" (if you can call it that) entries!</p>
        <p><a href="projects.html">My Projects page</a></p>
        <p>Where I link most, if not all projects I've worked on! (Note : It's really underwhelming)</p>
        <p><a href="where.html">My "Where" page!</a></p>
        <p>Where I link my other socials, like GitHub, Bluesky, etc...</p>
