        <h2>What is this?</h2>
 
        <p>This is my webpage hosted on GitHub, under my domain!</p>
        <p>I did this mostly so I can blog stuff and have a little place to write stuff outside of social media.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <h2>Why?</h2>

        <p>Well, I just thought it'd be fun to make webpages! It's just html though. Although, It's fun!</p>

    <div class="bodies">
        <h2>How many things are in here?</h2>
        <p>A lot! I count 25+ blog entries, alongside the entire memory section, and the 3 main pages :</p>
        <p><a href="who.html">Who am I?</a>, which well... says who I am! It also contains the info in the previous "Projects" and "Where" pages</p>
