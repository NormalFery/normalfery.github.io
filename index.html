        <h2>What is this?</h2>
 
        <p>This is my webpage hosted on GitHub, under my domain!</p>
        <p>I did this mostly so I can blog stuff and have a little place to write stuff outside social media.</p>

    <div class="bodies">
        <h2>Why?</h2>

        <p>Well, I just thought it'd be fun to make webpages! It's <s>just html though.</s> a blend of my HTML,
        CSS and JS abilities, along with some google searches for help! No AI!</p>
        <p>And yes that statement has been outdated since... <a href="https://github.com/NormalFery/normalfery.github.io/commit/c111c07f3d0d3ba0dc3bb59bcc08d2a5b220ebf4">Commit c111c07!
        </a>, or, if we want to get more specific (With styles in general, even if inline),  we have
        <a href="https://github.com/NormalFery/normalfery.github.io/commit/620ce7caaec36b5fdf39ecf0c2c691cf2e546b1f">Commit 620ce7c</a>, which is...
        The SECOND commit made in the site! It sure has been a while ^^</p>

        <h2>How many things are in here?</h2>
