        <h1>My thoughts on...</h1>
        <h2>Splatoon 3</h2>
        <div class="text">
        <p>Well, to start off this page, I've decided to start with the first game I was ever able to play on launch. Splatoon 3.</p>
        <p>To begin, I'm assuming you know about Splatoon as a Series, and the main mechanics it has. So to begin this, I'll start with the new things added.</p>
        <p>First off, we got 2 new moves, the Squid Surge, where you hold <b>B</b> while swimming on a wall, and then release it once charged to move up, and the Squid Roll, where if you quickly press B and then move your stick to the opposite side, you'll roll to the other side with barely any momentum loss, and also a small shield</p>
        <p>As for enviroments, We have the Splatlands, which is the new Hub, with new shopkeepers, and new Idols. This time, it's a trio. <FONT COLOR="#3439cf">Shiver</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#e6df30">Frye</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#f04141">Big Man</FONT>. These 3 idols represent 3 teams for Splatfests. Along with the Splatlands, with the <b>Expansion Pass</b> (25€ / $ DLC) you can access Inkopolis Plaza, and Inkopolis Square (after beating Side Order)</p>
        <p>As for multiplayers, we have the normal Turf Wars, and all 4 ranked modes, split in <b>Anarchy Battles</b> (Series or Open), and <b>X Battles</b> (Only from S+1 and Upwards)</p>
        <p>Now, with Splatfests, is where the bad things begin. With 3 teams, the themes are usually more lacking, and sometimes have a true right choice, making that team either completely win, or lose every other category. In order to have a balanced Splatfest, where mirror matches don't happen often, each team should have 33.33% votes, or anything from 30ish% to 36ish%, get more, and you'll face more mirror matches than normal, which means less matches that actually count.</p>
        <p>This isn't even counting Tri-Color, which makes it's own category, and is, in fact, a category that if your team wins, can make you get more points than the team who won Conch Shells and votes, which makes it rather pointless to play before the splatfest starts</p>
        <p>Of course, there's also another big problem, which is the Update Cycle. If you aren't familiar with it. All previous Splatoon games had semi-random updates, which brought a new weapon, or a new map, and were semi-frequent. In Splatoon 3, however, this was replaced in favour of the <b>Season Update Cycle</b></p>
        <p>In Splatoon 3, there is a Season which coincides with a real life Weather Season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter). Of course, this limits the content drops to 4 times a year.</p>
        <p>So far, there have been 7 seasons :</p>
        <p>Drizzle Season 2022 (Launch Season), from September 9th to November 30th, which gave us the first catalogue.</p>
        <p>Chill Season 2022 (Winter 2022), from December 1st to February 28th, which added 2 maps, and 13 weapons (10 kits & 3 new weapons)</p>
        <p>Fresh Season 2023 (Spring 2023), from March 1st to May 31st, which added 2 new Specials, 2 new maps, and 11 kits</p>
        <p>Sizzle Season 2023 (Summer 2023), from June 1st to August 31st, which added 2 maps and 11 weapons (2 new ones and 9 kits)</p>
        <p>Drizzle Season 2023 (Autumn 2023), from September 1st to August 31st, which added 2 maps, and 10 weapons (2 new ones and 8 kits)</p>
        <p>Chill Season 2023 (Winter 2023), from December 1st to February 29th, which added 2 new specials, and 9 kits, along with 2 maps</p>
        <p>Fresh Season 2024 (Spring 2024), from March 1st to May 31st, which added 11 weapons (2 new ones and 9 kits), and <b>A single new stage</b></p>
        <p>You can see a pattern here, right? Each season has had less kits than the older one. This, of course, has begged the question of 3rd kits even coming, or some weapons even getting 2nd kits. Of course, 2nd kits will be on every weapon, but 3rd kits seems farfetched, due to there going to be only 2 more seasons left before new content stops coming. Of course, this is rather infuirating, since there could've probably been more weapons by now if Nintendo didn't decide to add Seasons, and instead kept the old updating method</p>
        <p>Sadly, this is the reality, so in my opinion, despite the new content in it, Splatoon 3 is just not as good in content currently than before. I do not regret buying it, but it is making itself worse and worse, so unless nintendo manages to release around 20 or more kits in 2 seasons, I do not see this game being the first one with 3rd kits on everything (Despite being <b>Splatoon 3</b> and being full of the number 3.</p>
        <p>In the end, I do like this game, but I know it can be better, but Nintendo isn't trying    ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋     ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ </p>
