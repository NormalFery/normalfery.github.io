<div class="bodies">
  <h2>What is this?</h2>

  <h1>Explanations</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Kind of self-explanatory? We've never seen eachother, and I <b>really</b> wanna be able to see him and kiss him and just give him so much love
    </li>
    <li>
      Also self-explanatory, I wanna finish all my studies so I won't have to worry about exams, and have degrees to apply to jobs with
    </li>
    <li>
      More for the future than the present, but I do want to move with him to another country where I?ll be able to work in :3
    </li>
    <li>
      Mostly personal, but after certain things, I really want to get my own SIM card, with my own number, even if I have to change EVERYTHING including goverment paperwork.
      <br>Aside from that, just because I don't wanna depend on my parents
    </li>
    <li>Self-explanatory, yet again. I want my own money, be independent, not because my family is bad, I just want my own things without depending on scolarships</li>
    <li>I'm kind of working towards this? I really want to learn many programming languages and Java seems like a big candidate for now, specially since Joy, or Create: Colored</li>
    <li>I want to learn so much stuff. I wanna be able to develop in many fields!! Even if I'll suffer in the path there</li>
    <li>I really want to do content, make people happy, and, if everything goes well, maybe get some money from it, but that's in the far, far future</li>
    <li>The easiest one, but also kinda tiring? Mostly just so I can pride myself on translating the Wiki xd, even if I don't think that many people even use it</li>
    <li>Too many to specify.</li>
  </ol>
