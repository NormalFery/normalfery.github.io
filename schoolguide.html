  <h1>Fery's Guide to Spanish School Grades and such</h1>
  <h2>Written on Jul 8th 2025 - Updated that same day</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <p>So, if you are like me, and aren't from the US, you might have a <i>different</i> education system than K-12 (US), so here's my guide on
  "What do I mean with Medium Vocational Grade" </p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>The easier parts</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <p>So in Spain, <i>Obligatory / Mandatory</i> school is for people between 2-3 to 15-16 (Discrepancies since you start the year you turn 3, so a 2 year old born on December 2023 would start school on the school year 2025/2026)</p>
  <p>This means, you're in school (at least) 12 years, which are split in the following 3 steps :</p>
  <h3>"Kindergarten" / "Preschool"</h3>
  <p>This is a 3 year stage from the kid's start at 2-3 years old, and lasts until 5-6 years old. Kids here are usually taught to
  read, write, basic English and Spanish, but are expected to know at least how to talk and such.</p>
  <h3>"Primary School"</h3>
  <p>Picking up right when kids graduate Kindergarten, kids stay in this stage for 6 years, starting at 5-6 years old, and finishing at 11-12 years old.
  This is where kids learn more things like History, VERY basic Biology, Maths, Spanish, English, and a 3rd Language (on the last 2 years, which is usually French), Geography, etc...</p>
  <p>Back in my day, on my last year, my schedule had the following subjects (translated as 1:1 as I can from Spanish):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Maths</li>
    <li>Spanish</li>
    <li>French</li>
    <li>Social Sciences (Geography, History, etc..)</li>
    <li>Natural Sciences (BASIC Biology mostly)</li>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>Art</li>
    <li>Religion (or "Values", if you didn't want your kid to learn Religion)</li>
    <li>PE</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, this has changed QUITE A BIT, for example, my sister had 1 more subject, but that's beyond the point. Kids get taught many things that <i>should</i> be expanded upon on the next year</p>
  <h3>Secondary School</h3>
  <p>The time of puberty, and start learning to mature, Secondary School has 4 years, usually denominated "ESO" in Spanish, from ages 11-12 to 15-16.
    This is the last <i>obligatory</i> year, but there's many ways to expand your education later on.</p>
  <p>In this last step, Kids get to, on the later years, choose what subjects to choose, but that's beyond scope. Just know, here we also
  introduce a concept called <b>Vocational Grades</b></p>

  <h3>Vocational Grades</h3>
  <p>Vocational Grades can be started by any child in order to learn something more related to their interests, such as Tech, Makeup, etc...</p>
  <p>There are 3* types of grades, but what matters in the obligatory part, is that teens can choose to do a Vocational Grade instead of
  continuing through the last 2 years of Secondary School, and still "convalidate" as if they completed High School. They, however, can't access
  the same choice of further education options that kids in normal Secondary Grades can.</p>

<div class="bodies">
  <h2>Further Education</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <p>In Spain, Further education entails 2-ish paths that might merge at the end to Uni, if the student so desires (No longer child),
  those paths are :</p>
  <h3>Vocational Grades</h3>
  <p>Available to any student that completed either the "Basic" Vocational Grade, or finished Secondary School, they can go to a Medium one.</p>
  <p>After completing a Medium Grade, a student can go to a Superior one, and then access University. Each one is usually 2 years for completion.</p>
  <h3>Bachiller.</h3>
  <p>For anyone who wants Uni directly, and wants to do the PAU (University Access Test). Usually a pain in the ass, but only takes 2 years to complete.</p>

  <p>In my case, I went with Vocational Grades, because they're tailored to my interests.</p>
