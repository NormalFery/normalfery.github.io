    <h1>Blog 6 (March 8th 2024)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Recovery and Changes</h2>

    <p>Hi everyone! Fery here! So, I know that <a href=blog5.html>last blog</a>, I may have left you all a tad worried since, well... I did  state I was sick, so here's an update!</p>
    <p>I am <em>still</em> really sick. Well, not <em>really sick</em>, It's mostly just that I get coughing fits and it <b>hurts a fuckton</b>, so yeah. That's the sick update. </p>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Aside from that, what else is new? Easy!... My entire PC! I may have been sick, but the urge to build my pc instead of resting was really big, and in the end, I built it! It's way better than my laptop, which now got downgraded to "stay at home server" for <a href=https://discord.com/pQynBCGutJ>FRSS (Fery's Real Survival SMP)</a>, yes, that's a thing. Actually it's part of a <b><em>Modded minecraft server saga</em></b>, there's DRSS, CRSS, SDSS, and a heckton more!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text"></div>
    <p>Well, aside from Minecraft Server hosting, what else is there to say?... Oh yeah computer specs, here they are! :</p>
    <p>AMD Ryzen 5 5600G</p>
    <p>16 GB of DDR4 RAM (I am thinking of upgrading to 32GB soon though)</p>
    <p>AMD Radeon RX 6400 (dGPU)</p>
    <p>1 TB NVMe SSD from Kioxia</p>
    <div class="text">
    <p>Those are the specs! And here's the fun fact... The SSD is straight up from my laptop. I bought it for it like, a year or more ago, and when building the pc, I didn't buy storage because I was planning to rip the SSD off my laptop, shove it into the pc, and just enjoy not loosing my data. And it worked :3</p>
</div>
    <p>Lastly, I wanna announce that <em>soon</em>, I might move to <a href=https://git.gay>Git.Gay</a> because... It has .gay and it's gay, it fits me wayyy more</p>
    <p>So yup, I also might do a photo gallery! Well, see you guys next time!</p>
