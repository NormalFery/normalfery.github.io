            <h2>AKA : Sick day(s)</h2>
            <p>Yup, your boy got sick, great. I sure don't know why I am sick ¬¬</p>
            <p>Well, anyway, yeah, I am sick, yet writing basic HTML, who knew I'd be doing that (I indeed did.)</p>
            <p>So How did I get sick? You may (not) be asking yourselves. Easy, my sister.</p>
            <p>Let's paint a picture. The night of Sunday, February 25, just before it hit midnight, and monday came, she was sick.</p>
            <p>She had fever, cough, and we had to take her to the ER. Apparently, <em><b>She was incubating something.</b></em></p>
            <p>So after that, she had to take Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. She did, she eventually got better around Thursday, and everything's fine!</p>
            <h2><b><em>UNTIL</em></b></h2>
            <p>Comes Saturday afternoon, like, past 4 PM. My mom, sister, and I went out with my aunt and uncle to go do some shopping (mom hates driving), and we were all fine! Until later on, after getting home, My mom and I just start getting colder, and our temperature just skyrockets</p>
            <p>Suffice to say, my sister had passed on what she had to us. Yippie</p>
            <p>So basically, yup. I am sick right now, I have a headache (Although that's been slowly passing), and... yeah.</p>
            <p>Will update next time if I feel better!</p>
            <p>See you guys, on the next blog entry!</p>
