    <h1>Blog 14th (June 10th 2024)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Last day of school, just like any other.</h2>
    <p>Hi again everyone! Wow I'm starting to get a bit more active in here, lol</p>
    <p>Well, today's my last day of school! Yup, only mine, I'm apparently 1 out of like, other 3 kids that do well in class, and since the remaining 2 weeks until the end of the year (Jun 21st) are mostly for those kids to avoid failing their classes...</p>
    <p>I can start my vacation early and help my mom! Which is really nice because she deserves lots of help, mostly because of one single thing.</p>
    <p>My sister. I'm not saying she's bad, she's really good, what I mean is like, her school (She starts going to mine next school year) does this funny thing where they just, leave 1 hour early on June since it's the last month.</p>
    <p>You'd think "Oh that's really nice!" and sure it is for them, but for the parents it's a PAIN in the ass, because they leave at 12:30. She enters at 8:30. So for example, my mom, for the past few days has had to rush to do stuff because she barely gets time to do something like lunch, while ALSO having to get my sister.</p>
    <p>So instead, I'm the one that will go pick up my sister (and drop her off too), and just generally you know... Help a bit more at home. I really wanna help, so starting vacation early is such a plus</p>
    <p>Aside from that, it also means I get more free time in the afternoon for other things, like Particle SMP! If i make it to S2... haha. Along with that I got the whole, you know... life to figure out.</p>
    <p>I wanna try my best to like, either start a small summer job, or just learn to develop Minecraft mods, which is something I've always wanted to do but.... Java looks scary haha. If I ever do one though, I'll be sure to show you all!</p>
    <p>Along with developing, I made an alternate version of the default (Turquoise) color theme! A more darker and muted version of it, for the Changelog! Why? Because it's fun! And because I thought it deserved it's own color theme, despite being mostly just a place to store changes.</p>
    <p>Aside from that, I also wanna improve my blockbench skills, along with other things like, you know... just getting healthier habits (I will give up on the 3rd day, bet.)</p>
    <p>Well, that's all for now! Don't expect me to just leave though, I'll come back during summer to continue on the site!</p>
    <p>See you next time!</p>
