        <h2>AKA : Monthly Update</h2>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        
        <p>Hi everyone! Fery here once again! Of course, for your (Not as late as I thought) monthly update! I'm gonna tell you all everything that's gone on in my life this past month, and how it's been going! Ready? Let's go!</p>

        <h3>Animal Crossing New Horizons : The hole I ended up by accident</h3>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        
        <p>Yup, believe it or not, I got obsessed with ACNH, quite a bit too. I got it on Monday (19th) and I have already done quite a bit to my island and stuff. In general, I've done quite some progression, like The Museum, Nook's Cranny, and the Able Sister's clothes shop. Along with that, my partner decided to help me a lot, and I managed to level my house up to the max! (And made it pink too.) It was nice finally reaching that lmao, along with the fact that I have a <b>lot</b> of screenshots, but they're on my switch for now.</p>

    <div class="bodies">
        
        <h3>More MRCL! A lot of MRCL...</h3>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        
        <p>Yup, I've been playing wayyyy more MRCL, how much? Well... A lot! Last I was here, I think I said I got to beta test some features alone, but now... I got to beta test features with other veterans and patreon members! It was chaotic lmao. We did find a bunch of bugs, and some stuff that should be improved (I managed to find a logic flaw!) and the <b>Elevated Functions</b> update released! Now it's public for everyone to play! It was great seeing how the devs made progress and the fact that they established a robust base to expand is really nice for the future of the server! Now the next updates will be quite far away, since first there's a Pre-update checklist. But I'm sure that the Digital Sea will see it's glory sooner than later! If you guys wanna see any of the updates, you should check on the <a href="https://wiki.mrcl.cc">MRCL Wiki!</a> Why? Well... Because I help translate it to Spanish :3 (I've also written the Customization and Interface Programs pages!)</p>

        <h3>Unhealthy obsession with certain songs</h3>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies" >
        
        <p>So yup, here's the part where I talk about songs I've been obsessed with (and even did covers of them kinda, not public tho!). First off, of course, what everyone that even remotely knows vocaloid has heard at least once, I've been (unsurprisingly) mesmerized by Mesmerizer! (32ki), and oh my god I just love it so much, I don't know why, but I just keep playing it over and over and over without end! It's probably gonna become unhealthy at some point but not yet! Haha.
            
        <br><br>
            
        Along with other vocaloid songs that are stuck in my head, there's Triple Baka! Which was the first song I decided to try to make a cover off using SynthV and Vocaloid4 Pirated! It was.... Painful. But I managed to make it work!... Somehow. Also Rabbit Hole is there too but we don't talk about that (yet)</p>

            <h3>School is (almost) here!</h3>

    </div>

    <div class="bodies">
            <p>So of course, since we're at the tail end of august, and about to start September, that means that I'll continue with my studies! This year is a bit different thought, since I have to do an internship at a company! I hope that being a good student means I get a good internship.. Along with that, I have absolutely no idea who's gonna be in my class, but I hope that the good classmates from last year do come this one! And the bad ones either leave, or just get thrown away quickly enough. Aside from that, well... Not many news yet! I'll try to update you next month, but I'll be busier since class! (Maybe I can get my teachers to let me do the site on my free time lmao)</p>

    <div class="bodies" style="text-align: center;" >
            <p>So... that's about everything for now! See you guys next time! :3 <br> - Fery</p>
