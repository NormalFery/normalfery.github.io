        <h1>Blog 19 (January 6th 2025)</h1>
        <h2>AKA : Monthly Update</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Howdy Everyone! Been a bit since I last came here and actually posted an update, sorry for that, but... I can finally talk about stuff! So let's get right into it!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bodies">
        <h1>Server Update</h1>
        <p>So as I said <a href="../2024/blog18.html">last update</a>, I was working on a server where I'd selfhost stuff! Here's an update :
        <br /></p>
        <h2>IT'S ALMOST DONE</h2>
        <p>Yes, I know, it's not done yet, but I got the last piece I needed a few days ago and have to work on, well.. Assembling it! The only caveat is the fact that, well... The case it'll use is not mine. </p>
        <p>Yup, it's from my high school, since I'm gonna use the server as my end of year project! And given how complex it'll be, I bet I'll probably pass with a high mark! Hopefully... Aside from that, here are the server specs!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CPU : Ryzen 5 5600G (I know, not the best but it'll work!)</li>
            <li>RAM : 32 GB DDR4 (2x16 <abbr title="If I recall correctly?">iirc?</abbr>)</li>
            <li>Motherboard : <abbr title="To Be Added">TBA</abbr> (I forgot)</li>
            <li>Storage : A lot (Like, at least 8TB+)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I know, not the best specs, but it works, and the most stressful thing that'll run there are MC servers. And yes, I know the server has an APU but I wanna kinda you know, be able to SEE the stuff in the server so I can install Debian and such</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <h1>Pridecraft Updates</h1>
        <p>Yup, I got Pridepack (PGUI) stuff to talk about! This time...</p>
        <h2>Mod Compatibility!</h2>
        <h3>(Sorta)</h3>
        <h4>(Kinda)</h4>
        <h5>(Not soon)</h5>
        <p>To be honest, this is mostly related to this issue / suggestion : <a href="https://github.com/Pridecraft-Studios/prideGUI/issues/10">#10</a>, which suggest to add gui support for a BUNCH of mods</p>
        <p>Just wanna leave as a disclaimer it's for 1.20.1 / Legacy, so... don't expect EVERY mod to be compatible with PGUI :sob: (You can suggest them tho)</p>
        <p>Aside from that, I fixed the <b>CORNER OF DOOM</b> that has doomed PGUI ever since it was created in... Oh fuck it's 4 days until PGUI is 1 year old OH MY GOD</p>
        <h2>PrideGUI is nearly 1 year old</h2>
        <p>So uh... This is awkward. PrideGUI, the thing i've been mostly maintaining myself, is a year old and I kinda... Find it odd??</p>
        <p>Like- I'm proud of myself for not just dropping it and even doing more stuff (Like Legacy, or Light Mode), but it still feels... <i>odd.</i></p>
        <p>It's the only project I've ever been a part off that doesn't really have a conclusion. It just starts, and it must keep being maintained. I've never been part of something like that, most stuff I do has an ending in sight, except this</p>
        <p>I still even remember when I created PGUI, and even when it released (And when the first update released, done through <abbr title="Windows Live Messenger">WLM</abbr> iirc?)</p>
        <p>But yeah, it's been quite a year, I hope I can finish the mod textures BEFORE it turns 1 (I won't)</p>

        <h1>Streaming every so often</h1>
        <p>So, if you've seen my Youtube channel "recently", I've started to stream Splatoon (3) stuff every so often! And that means that with the announced Chocolate fest rerun...</p>
        <p>I'll be streaming both days!</p>
        <p>Aside from that, I don't have much to say... I might do something in <i>Twitch</i> soon as well, maybe find a way to multistream? I'll have to think about it</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Aside from this, I don't have much more for this monthly update...</p>
        <p>I'll see you guys, next time!</p>
