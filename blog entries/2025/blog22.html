    <h1>Blog 22 (April 10th 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Monthly Blog</h2>
</div>

<div class="bodies">
    <p>Howdy everyone! Fery here, once again, to present to you the new revamp of the website!... Which isn't much, but hey! At least it's better than before!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Website Revamp</h2>
    <p>So, if you didn't notice immediately upon opening the site, we got a little bit of a... "facelift", with a new font<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk?preview.text=according%20to%20all%20known%20laws&lang=es_Latn&script=Latn&categoryFilters=Appearance:%2FTheme%2FTechno">Space Grotesk</a>
    and dropdowns for the thigns to be organized! :3 </p>
    <p>So you may be asking, why did I do it? Well... Because yems :3 I do have a reason though! Aside from the whole "I wanted" reason, it's because I wanted to add a <b>Style Changer</b> later on, with JavaScript (scary!), but of course, I wanted it to be on the navbar! However, for it to be, I needed more space just in case, and
    one thing lead to the other and suddenly, I made a new branch that won't matter much (I'll use it for testing though!)</p>
    <p>As for the font, well.... I got tired of Times New Roman, and just wanted something more rounded (Although this one screws with my :3s)</p>
    <p>You also may have noticed, "Where's the Thoughts section?", or "Where's the changelog?" And uh. They're gone. I don't really have a reason to maintain them, and, honestly,
    I just really didn't want to deal with them. They were just not worth revamping. All blog posts will be their own changelogs and such!</p>
    <p>Aside from that, let's see what more has happened these past few... days? Dang.</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>More Working</h2>
    <p>Of course, I've been working on my internship, and I think I've been doing a good job! Hopefully, at least. At least I can use my knowledge later on for this site too! If I remember :3'</p>
    <p>Aside from that, there aren't that many news from my internship, aside from me taking the bus at 7:10 every morning (I thought I missed it today, I didn't)</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>A Minecraft Movie</h2>
    <h3>Yes, I watched it</h3>
    <p>Yup, I went to watch A Minecraft Movie with my friends on premiere day! Not the first session, there was NO way we were getting there that early. However, we did watch it regardless!</p>
    <p>Honestly? It wasn't that bad! We really liked it, and we made memories together watching it! ^^ , Also the memes. oh my god the memes. They're so fucking good :sob:</p>
    <p>I do have a photo of us after coming out from the movies, it is in 3ds quality though, so don't blame me for it being not very good x,p</p>
    <img src="../../images/amm_selfie.jpg" class="images-single" alt="" width="33%">
    <p>From left to right, I'll give nicknames based on online  nicknames : It's Me (Fery), <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidvegeta.bsky.social">DavidVegeta,</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhamty.bsky.social">Zhamty</a>, and rightmost, down, Amaunyan0 (He doesn't seem to have social media :sob:), honestly I'm so glad we're friends, like, holy fuck they're just the best.</p>
    <p>Like, this could easily be its own Memory post (so I'll keep it here), because I'm so glad we are friends x,d</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>So, I know this isn't quite a lot, but still, Monthly Update! ^^ I <b>Finally</b> get to talk about my friends too, even if for like, 2 paragraphs, but hey! Something is something</p>
    <p>See you guys next time!</p>
    <p>- Fery</p>
