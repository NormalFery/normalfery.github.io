    <h1>Blog 25 (May 5th 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : More travel shenanigans, wiki writing, etc..</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Hi everyone! Fery here, yet again, after 3 weeks for more updates on everything that's been going on in my life! Let's get started!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Travel Shenanigans The Second (Ft. Fatima7732)</h2>
    <p>Yup, just like a few weeks ago, I once again took a bus, and with my sister went travel around the island to get bread (And actually do some trips)</p>
    <p>First of all, of course, was <i>bread</i>, because I wanted some (And I wanted to take her for breakfast) so have some photos of her at the bakery with me eating breakfast xd</p>
    <div class="images">
        <img src="../images/act_nice.JPG" alt=""  width="28%">
        <img src="../images/fatifoto.JPG" alt=""  width="28%">
        <img src="../images/Fatima_Breakfast.JPG" alt=""  width="50%">
    </div>
    <p>I had breakfast too, but I just like sharing photos of her more x,d, the file should be <a href="../images/Churro_Chocolate.JPG">here</a> though, if you wanna know what I ate</p>
    <p>After that, we went riding around, back to the Big City:tm:, then to another city to see the shops (they were closed. We didn't know it was a holiday x,d), and after that, we just went back home at like 12 PM (After doing a quick cat food & litter run)</p>
    <p>Not a lot to talk about from there, but it was fun ^^</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Wiki Writing</h2>
    <p>As some of you <i>might</i> know, I (sometimes) write in the <a href="https://wiki.mrcl.cc">MRCL Wiki</a>, specifically in the Spanish one, to translate it since not many other people do</p>
    <p>Well I have been kidnapped by them. <br>I'm in their basement and they're making me translate <br> Help me.</p>
    <h6>(I'm joking, it's very nice in there and it's just lovely, I just wish I could translate more often x,d (i also wish I had the skills to become a builder but sadly i'm a jack of all trades, master of none))</h6>

<div class="bodies">
    <h2>PrideGUI 3.0.0 (& Legacy 2.0.0)</h2>
    <p>So, after a <i>few</i> issues regarding mod compat, and a lot of struggling, I'll probably regret saying this later but <a href="https://pridecraft.gay/pridegui">PrideGUI</a> 3.0.0 should be ready for public release sometime soon! Along with Legacy 2.0.0, which is the version with a lot of the compat</p>
    <p>Before the list, if there's an "(M)" next to the mod name, it's because the mod is in both <b>main</b> (1.20.2+), and <b>Legacy</b> (1.20.1), note that if it doesn't have the symbol, it just isn't in main</p>
    <p>In order, the mod compat added has been :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No Chat Reports (M)</li>
        <li>Fabric API (the switching buttons for the creative menu)</li>
        <li>Roughly Enough Items and Eek! My Items! (EMI)</li>
        <li>Supplementaries</li>
        <li>Amethyst Imbuement</li>
        <li>Axiom (M)</li>
        <li>Sidekick (M)</li>
        <li>Litematica (M)</li>
        <li>Inventory Profiles Next (M)</li>
        <li>Create 0.5.x (Until 6.0.0 releases in Fabric)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I want to <i>kinda</i> thank <a href="https://github.com/Thinkseal">ThinkSeal</a> for being the one to open all the issues and do all the testing xd</p>
    <p>Aside from that, unless any more issues pop up before release, hopefully it should be released soon!</p>

    <h2>Night Zone - The Future?</h2>
    <p>So for anyone that joined Night Zone thanks to this website, or just found my website from there, I hope this comes out at least shortly before/after Eep's announcement but I really want to get this here already</p>
    <p>Night Zone will be changing ownership soon, and I'll be the one taking over it. He'll, of course, stay, but I'll be kind of the... "Owner" I think? I'm not sure, but today marks the day the announcement is made, and I really can't wait to see what the future brings for Night Zone</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>There isn't much more to talk about for today so...</p>
    <p>See you next time! - Fery</p>
