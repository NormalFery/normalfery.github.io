        <h2>AKA : Stress in school</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone! Sorry for the lack of updates, I'm here with some big ones, but mostly, to talk about my stress at school because <b>oh my god i am stressed as fuck help me.</b> Well, let's get started!</p>
        <p>First off, I wanna say the <b>Main source of my stress</b>, which is basically my networking class, where we had a project of making a network (like, RJ45, patch pannels) and once after, do VLANs with a managed switch. Of course, my group wasn't able to do it in time, and we've been writing the written report as much as possible</p>
        <p>Luckily enough, my teacher, by some miracle, will allow us to join another group who'd be on the same table as we were once they got to the same point we did, so... that's nice! </p>
        <p>Aside from that, we have many other assigments like other activities and stuff to fill in the time until to 10th, which, if I get lucky, will be the <b>Last day of school</b> (for me at least), so... That's something to look up to!</p>
        <p>Well, with that, what about my other classes? Well...</p>
        <h3>Montaje (Like, building pcs and stuff)</h3>
        <p>I have like, 3 assignments to do between today and Monday, might do them on the weekend if I get bored.</p>
        <h3>Office Applications (Like Google Docs, Sheets, Audacity for some reason)</h3>
        <p>I'm uh... Kinda finished with that class lmao. Got no more homework, and there's just... empty space I can now use to play Minecraft!... And finish my networking homework if I see Minecraft ain't fun</p>
        <h3>Operative Systems (VMs and related)</h3>
        <p>So this is kind of a weird limbo, the teacher puts new homework in the platform (EVAGD for some weird reason), and well... We just do it. I've technically finished all for now, but he can just whip out a new assignment tomorrow lmao, but once I finish it's back to Minecraft, or to other classes' homework</p>
        <h3>Labour Oriented Formation (FOL)</h3>
        <p>Basically dead time that, unless stated by the teacher, can't be used because we have to keep our screens off and just listen to him, or listen to my horrible classmates present their horrible presentations. There are <b>Some</b> good ones, but it's like, 1 out of 15</p>
        <p>The worst thing is how they read the fucking slides like, this ain't uh... Oh fuck, wait, I need to do School year translations.</p>
        <p>I'm just gonna whip out one of those tables and... yeah.</p>

          <p>* Cycles reffers to the use of "Ciclo", it's more of a vocational grade, where you go for 2 years and specialize in a certain category</p> 
          <p>So basically, this isn't fucking Grade 6th of primary school, you're not only in something NOT OBBLIGATORY (After 16 you can just choose to continue studies or not), you are ALSO supposed to keep things to at least a higher standard.</p>
          <p>Sooo yea, a single class has me on edge with tons of stress. Luckily enough I know i'll pull through (aside from the group project, i have to carry a dead weight and a fragile dead weight in that one), so... Yup, see you guys next time!</p>
