  <h1>Blog 9 (May 3rd 2024)</h1>
  <h2>AKA: Monthly Update 2</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="bodies">
    <p>Hi everyone! Fery here on another Monthly Blog! (Yes these are monthly from now on unless I make them outside their times).</p>
    <p>In this entry, I'm gonna talk about mostly what I did in April up until Yesterday (May 2nd), mostly just highlighting the stuff I think should be highlighted! Well, let's start!</p>
    
    <h3>Springfest : The fluff Splatfest</h3>
    <p>First off, of course, to feed off my Splatfest obsession, is Springfest! This one happened from April 20th til April 22nd! It was quite fun! Albeit a bit boring since this time I didn't get to play with my friends, at least Team Bear Cubs won! That's nice!</p>
    <p>The Splatfest Results were the following! (I'm trying tables sob, if my code sucks it's because it's the first time I HTML)</p>

    <p>(Got that was a pain to make) Anyway, yeah! Bear cubs won! And Frye got screwed again due to her popularity (Ironic)</p>
    <p>With Splatoon aside, let's talk about something else! What about...</p>
    
    <h3>Old Tech Obsession!</h3>
    <p>So lately I've been thinking about old tech, and even bought some! So... What did I buy due to that obsession? Well...</p>
    <p>First off, I bought <a href=https://www.ebay.es/itm/386897588909>This Laptop!</a> It's a Lenovo Thinkpad R61, which came with German Windows XP, which I upgraded to Spanish Windows 7 for my mom!</p>
    <p>It wasn't as cheap as I thought but I managed to win the bid! So what is it's IO like? Well, it has...</p>
    <p>A Charger Port (Of course)</p>
    <p>Headphones out & Mic In</p>
    <p>CD/DVD Drive</p>
    <p>3 USB 2.0 (maybe?) Ports</p>
    <p>A Gigabit RJ45 Port AND an RJ11 Modem</p>
    <p>A VGA Port</p>
    <p>A PCCard Slot! (which i SOMEHOW confused with a Floppy Disk drive sob)</p>
    <p>A fingerprint scanner! (And it's "Old" tech)</p>
    <p>So yeah! I bought it, along with a box of 95 floppy disks! Those haven't got here yet, I'll make sure to update if they arrive!</p>
    <p>So, why did I want this pc?... Well, first off, because it has an RJ11, and I just so happen to have a Landline in my home, so I just... been testing RJ11 stuff at home! It's fun, I almost got a dial up connection but the free user thing seems to not work, sad :( (And yes, I searched, only 1 company has dial up, all others do ADSL, which is being phased out for fiber)</p>
    <p>Aside from that, my school was throwing really old pcs that had nothing more to use, and I managed to get something from them that I always wanted, it was a...</p>
    <p>Floppy Disk drive! (Internal of course), So I just got it after disassembling the PC (well, the 2nd year students did it, not me, even if I wanted to help, shotout to them!) and I have it at home! Where it's waiting for some random AliExpress board to arrive so I can use it over USB! Yes I'm gonna use fucking floppies and no one can stop me.</p>
    <p>And now, from old tech to...</p>
    <h3>New Stuff! (Tech)</h3>
    <p>So what did I get? Well... Not much tbh, I'm not some rich guy. But I did get a new 960 GB SSD for my PC! (Internal), because who knew a 1 TB SSD was NOT enough for everything I do at home :/</p>
    <p>Luckily enough, it'll get here sooner than the floppies probably, it'll arrive probably mid-next week, where I'll hopefully make a new blog about it! Or just update this page, either one of the two things.)</p>
    <p>So yeah! That's it! There's not much more to state, say, or related.. Thank you for reading!</p>
    <p>See you next time,</p>
    <p>- Fery</p>
