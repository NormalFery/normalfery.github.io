        <p>You read that correctly! Nintendo Network is 100% gone as of uh... A few hours ago actually. At the time of writing it's 9:15 AM, so 8:15 UTC, and NN shut down at 1 AM UTC... Kind of.</p>
        <p>You see, NN didn't exactly get shut down, Nintendo just blocked new logins from happening in NN servers starting at 1 AM. And you'd think "Well that'd mean everyone would get kicked off!"... Not really actually</p>
        <p>In actuality, NN still lets authenticated users from pre-shutdown to access it's servers for matchmaking, but if you even disconnect for a second from the servers, it's game over for you. That means that there are some determined people that still are "playing" Splatoon 1 online (mostly just staring at the matchmaking screen), <a href="https://twitter.com/Lcd101/status/1777600453112402404">Like this one (Twitter Link)</a> which I honestly find kind of funny</p>
        <p>You'd think Nintendo would go and just shut down everything Nintendo Network related, in fact, people like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/OatmealDome">OatmealDome</a> thought so, because it'd make the most sense!... We were wrong lmao, People are still up, playing Splatoon 1 (well, trying to), and it's funny.</p>
        <p>Well, aside from that. "What now?" You may be asking. Well, it's time to pretend like nothing happen and just get <b>Pretendo</b></p>
        <p>"What's Pretendo" you may not be asking at all, well, it's basically like NN's replacement, and it's really cool, and you should <a href="https://pretendo.network/">Check them out!</a></p>
        <p>Well, that's all for this blog!</p>
        <p>Until next time... Stay Fresh!</p>
