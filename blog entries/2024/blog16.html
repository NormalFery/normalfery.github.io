        <h2>AKA : Monthly Update</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Hi everyone! Fery here once again for the monthly update! Here's a TL;DR of what's been going on & later on, bigger explanations of each!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <h3>TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read)</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>So basically, I updated PrideGUI to 1.21, made PrideGUI Legacy (Pride GUI for 1.6.1 - 1.20.1), and also have been playing more Minecraft</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        <h3>Pride GUI (& Legacy!)</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Yup, it finally happened. I finally made <a href="https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pridegui">PrideGUI</a> for 1.21! (2.0.0, or, 18.2.0 according to the old versioning system). Along with that, I also released <a href=https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/pridegui-legacy>PrideGUI Legacy!</a>, it's basically PrideGUI, except, of course, for 1.20.1 and earlier! It contains "new" textures for old GUIs, and well, not much more related to it! </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <h3>Whoa, text warping?</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Yup! After a loooong time, I've done yet another huge site update! Now the text finally wraps around instead of going on completely from left, it'll wrap around around uh... 1200 pixels! You can check the css! I wanna say thanks to <a href="../../memories/memory1.html">my boyfriend</a> for helping me with the whole CSS part! He's so kind I swear to god</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        <h3>2 week* Minecraft phase!</h3>
    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Yup, just like anyone else, I already went through my 2 week minecraft phase! Except it was... Over 2 weeks and it's still going! It's in fact, as strong as ever before!
            ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ ᠋ I really don't know how I made it so far, but I did! So here's screenshots from the servers I've been playing & A console screenshot from a server I'm hosting rn! :3 (I also just learnt how to make more than 1 image per line)

    </div>
    
    <div class="bodies" >
        <p>Yup! lots of stuff! Also from now on the code is gonna be sooo messy because the images make me offset stuff manually, yayy...</p>
    
  
        <p>So after all this, I actually don't really know what more to add, the whole "I actually do padding and stuff now" Feels really huge now, so aside from that... There's not much more to say! Thank you for reading and well...</p>

        <p>See you next time!</p>
