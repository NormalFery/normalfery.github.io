            <h1>Blog 10 (May 6th 2024)</h1>
            <h2>AKA: The Colorful Update!</h2>
            <p>Hi everyone! So before anything, welcome to the <b>10th blog entry!!</b></p>
            <p>It may not have been more than a few months since the <a href="blog1.html">First entry</a>, but still, this means a lot to me!</p>
            <p>For example, it shows that I've finally have worked on a project more than usual! (Wayyy more, I usually drop projects after like, 2 weeks at MOST)</p>
            <p>So yeah! Well, now, what do I mean with the colorful update?</p>
            <p>Well, if you have checked the <a href="https://github.com/NormalFery/normalfery.github.io">Github Repo & Code</a>, or just well... Came here, you probably have seen that the site is more... Pink!</p>
            <p>And you may be asking "Why is it pink?" Well... Because this is the blog section! Yup, now I divide the site in sections :3</p>
            <p>There are currently <b>4</b> site sections! There's the main site (index, projects, where and whoami), then this section, the blog entries, and the two brand new <b>Memory</b> and <b>Thoughts</b> sections!</p></b></p>
            <p>If you look up in the navbar, you can see the new links! Those are our new sections!</p>
            <p>Along with them, there's 2 other color schemes! Which I've named! :3 In fact, I named all 4 schemes! They're just "style[number].css" in the code because i'm lazy and it's easier to replace a number than an entire word</p>
            <p>So... Their names are :</p>
            <p>Turquoise Blast! (Previous Only Style)</p>
            <img src="../images/turquoise.png" height="480">
            <p>Light Pink! (Old Memories related pages)</p>
            <img src="../images/lightpink.png" height="250">
            <p>Dark Pink! (Blog entry pages, the one in here!)</p>
            <img src="../images/darkpink.png" height="320">
            <p>And lastly, Monochromatic! Or Monochrome (Thoughts section)</p>
            <img src="../images/monochrome.png" height="250">
            <p>So yeah! Those are the new themes! It took me <b>Wayyyyy too long</b> to make them readable and still like I wanted. I may have to fix other things later on though, after all, the VSCode html preview isn't really good with telling me what links I visited (That's why Light Pink had a quick style.css hotfix)</p>
            <p>But yeah! That's all! I'll see you on the next blog post!</p>
            <p>- Fery</p>
