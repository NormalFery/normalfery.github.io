        <h1>Blog 21 (March 26th 2025)</h1>
        <h2>AKA : Internships and Such</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Howdy everyone! Fery here, yet again, for another update! Yup, less than 10 days and I'm already here, I seem desperate, right? Haha</p>
        <p>Anyway, lets get started!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <h2>Internships @ Somewhere</h2>
        <p>So of course, even if I've already made <i>many</i> of my things public, I <i><b>reaaaallly</b></i> don't think I can say much about this business, or, well, much about stuff here that can be identifiable, so I'll just refer to the business as... "Internship Co" and my high school as "HS Super Meh", and well, time to go on!</p>
        <p>So I started internships on Monday <b>(March 24th '25)</b> and I've been pretty much just... been there? I have been working, kinda, I've been doing the Cisco JS courses, I finished the first one today, and I'm probably gonna finish the 2nd one... Tomorrow maybe? Friday at <b>Most</b> since it's quite a step up?</p>
        <p>Regardless of that, its been pretty good! Aside from, well... the fact that PHP and MySQL still terrorize me. And they're something we're gonna use. Not gonna say <i>why</i>, it's just the framework to use :'3 Of course I'm <b>very</b> willing to do it, it's just... <i>scary</i></p>
        <p>Aside from that though, I found out 2 of my coworkers live close to me (kinda), and one of them just helped me save like, over an hour on bus travel time alone, because yes, I take the bus :''3</p>
        <h3>Buses are... Something.</h3>
        <p>Sooo, of course, I take the bus! I can't really go with a coworker since A. It's akward <br>B. Most, if not all of them don't live near, or start earlier than me</p>
        <p>Of course that's entirely reasonable, I'm not gonna barge in and be like "omg you should conform to my scheduleee &gt;~&lt;",<br> that'd be very entitled, and bad, and I'm really not that kinda person???</p>
        <p>Like, yes, if I have the chance, I'll accept but otherwise I won't demand, plus I already use the bus to go buy bread, so I don't mind, in fact, I like it, I can guarantee I do enough trips to keep the free bus thing!</p>
        <p>The only problem? Schedules. As in, I literally cannot do anything about it. "Take a later bus" and <i>risk</i> the chance of getting there too late?? No thank you, I'm fine like this. Sure, I get there like half an hour later, but that doesn't mean I <b><i>hate</i></b> it. The big problem comes when I head back home</p>
        <p>So back home there's like, 2 bus lines that go there, one goes there, and then further south, the other one goes to my town, then back to big city:tm:, so good connections, right?</p>
        <p>THat's until you realize the direct line is way faster than the town one, which means many people, both returning at the afternoon, and leaving in the morning. So there's a huge queue of people waiting for it in the terminal on the afternoon, and many people in the bus in the morning... fun.</p>
        <p>Aside from that, though, I don't really wanna start complaining since I kinda don't pay for the bus? That's a topic for another time, though</p>

    <div class="bodies">
        <p>So I know this isn't much, but still, I wanted to talk about it!</p>
        <p>So yup, this is all, and see you next time!</p>
