            <h2>AKA: Splatfest, Splatoon, etc...</h2>

            <p>So that was quite a weekend... Anyway here's a TL;DR</p>


            <p>A Splatoon 3 Splatfest happened where one of the teams had over 60% of votes. It lost. Now I'll go in depth about why, and many other things that happened this weekend (Enjoy my 4h sleep self lmao)</p>
            <p>So first off, here's the Splatfest results, and everything :</p>
            </div>
            <div class="nso">
            <img src="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:xf3hcm7vkirzgbln5u26ibus/bafkreieaqv2r4wykngxbeh7ht7grdqf36yjaovsqzufmg2w7dm4qtka57u@jpeg" height="480">
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>So you may think "What's the problem?" Well... In Splatoon we have these things called "Mirror matches", where if after a certain period of matchmaking time, there aren't enough enemy team members to battle against, you'll just...</p>
            <p>Battle your own team, which won't count toward the results!...</p>
            <p>You can see the problem now, right?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>Here's the thing tho, mirror matches have been a thing for years, and while when there were two teams, it wouldn't matter, since it'd be a 60/40%, but when there's 3 teams, now if it's more than a 40%, you're 100% guaranteed to loose by mirror matches.</p>
            <p>So here's what I think should be done about it :</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>First, remove mirror matches. I know it may mean having the "Not enough players" error, but at least matches would count.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>Secondly, balance the options??? Don't just give a single team the best option, since it'd mean many people flock to it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>And yeah, that's it.</p>
            <p>Now, aside from that, well...</p>
            <p>Side Order is in... 3 days???!?!? (It's Monday 19th when I'm writing this) I am way to excited for it. I'll definitively be spoiling things which will be marked in future blog entries.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>Also, I may skip school since honestly, I'm too bored there, so I can just get "sick" and not come, way better than coming and just being bored without doing anything. In any case I can just do the work's day the next day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodies">
            <p>Well, with all of that said, there isn't much more to say! So...</p>
            <p>See you next time!</p>
