    <h1>Blog 24 (April 22nd 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Server Hosting , New themes, and more bus rides</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Howdy everyone! Fery here, just barely under a week after my last update, for new stuff! So let's get started! ^^</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>New themes</h2>
    <p>Remember when I said in the last log that "I'd add new themes from some of the scrapped pages" (Did I say that? Hopefully xd), so...
    We now have two new themes! <b>Dark (Monochrome)</b>, from the old Thoughts section, and <b>Green Blast (Changelog)</b> from the changelog!</p>
    <p>They've both been given a refresh so they work on every page! Along with them, now you can finally reset your theme! That way, if you want to go back to per page themes, you can! ^^</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Minecraft Hosting?</h2>
    <p>Yup! After a bit of talking with one of my friends, I'm hosting a Minecraft Server now! ^^ It's <a href="https://discord.gg/jAHcMsu8S8">Night Zone</a> (S2)! A Forge
    server with Create, and a fuckton of other mods! So many that we're pregenerating the world! It'll launch on <b>May 1st</b>, and anyone can join!</p>
    <p>In fact, you should join it! The more people, the merrier! I <i>might</i> stream myself in it, but I'm not quite sure.</p>
    <p>What I do know is that pregenerating is something the server despises a lot :3</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Bus rides - ft. Fatima7732</h2>
    <p>
        Yup, just like last time, me and my sister did some bus rides yesterday. This time, we went to Big City :tm: For one single reason, to get her bus pass!
        <br>So away we went! We got on the bus (One arrived just by coincidence LMFAO), and went to the Big City, and after waiting in a long queue for our turn...
        <br>We were done :3 But we didn't get home :33 Instead I took my sister around the Big part of the Big City :tm: and went to
        <ul>
    <li>A shopping mall, one with a LOT of floors, but we didn't have the time for all floors so we just went to one floor</li>
    <li>A grocery store to get the cat food, I think it was more expensive there though..</li>
    <li>And another mall just to look around a bit! ^^</li>
</ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        We didn't really do much after, aside from going back home, but still, it was nice!
    </p>
</div>
<div class="bodies"><p>And that's it from me for today! Quite nice to be doing more web dev, even if it's at work. <br> See you next time, <br>- Fery!</p></div>
