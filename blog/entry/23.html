    <h2>AKA : Buying bread - As a <a href="https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/what-is-celiac-disease/">Celiac</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Howdy everyone! Fery here, literally less than a week later, for yet another blog post! Before anything thought...</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Fancy Themes</h2>
    <p>Yup! As you can see (And as I said in my Bluesky), all the different section's themes are available everywhere now! You can use this page's theme on the main page, or viceversa! The combinations are endless!</p>
    <p>Also, added literally JUST NOW (lmfao) are cookies! No I am not selling your data. No I am not doing anything with them, they're just there to store the theme you pick! I <i>hope</i> i'm not breaking the law with that,
    I really don't feel like breaking it right now</p>
    <p>Now with that out of the way, let's talk about buying bread as a Celiac!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Buying Bread as a Celiac</h2>
    <h3>Yes That's this section's title again</h3>
    <h4>I'm not kidding</h4>
    <p>So, Sunday Evening, I wanted to go buy some bread on Monday Morning, sounds easy, right? Go down to the bakery, get some bread, pay, boom. Easy, right?</p>
    <p>Except there aren't any <i>Gluten Free</i> bakeries nearby. And <i>I can't eat gluten</i>, so that easy, maybe 10-15 minute trip, has suddenly involved 2 buses and 2 tram rides, my sister,
    and a lot of money. So, let's get started</p>
    <h3>Monday Morning - 6 to 7:20 AM</h3>
    <p>This is the same time I wake up to go to the internships. I woke up, took a bath, got ready, and ate breakfast. My sister? She was getting ready too, just woke up later.</p>
    <p>This part of the thing is easier, just get ready, wait a bit if it's too early, and then head to the Bus Stop downstairs, simple as that.</p>
    <h3>7:20(ish) - 8:05(ish)</h3>
    <p>We head to the Bus Terminal at Big City:tm: on the bus. Fatima and I just talk, and not much more, it was her first time heading to Big City on the bus thought</p>
    <p>After that, we get to the terminal, and we ask if she got her "I can go anywhere for free since I'm a resident" card, we were too early yet, we had to wait a few days.</p>
    <p>After that, we go down two floors, and head to the tram terminal, as we arrive, oh no, the tram just left, we have to wait for the next one</p>
    <h3>8:05 - 8:50</h3>
    <p>Tram arrives, we head  in, and just talk. Where are we going? To the gluten-free bakery, on the Second Big City:tm:, just 2 busses and a tram (Or 1 bus and 1 tram) away!</p>
    <p>She took some photos of the outside, I took a few of her inside, observe them, please</p>
    <div class="images">

    <img src="../../assets/images/tree_tram.jpeg" alt="" width="20%">
    </div>
    <p>Yes I know my implementation of images is flawed, give me a break, x,p. But yes, we were outside, and after a long tram ride and a bit of walking...</p>
    <h3>8:50 - 9:05</h3>
    <p>We finally got to the bakery! I bought bread (of course) , and I decided to get my sister some churros and chocolate for her to have breakfast for once</p>
    <p>We loved them (I've already tried them before, but I still love them soooo much god.), here, take another look at her and the food</p>
    <div class="images">
        <img src="../../assets/images/F_Churro.JPG" alt="" width="33%">
        <img src="../../assets/images/F_Baker.JPG" alt="" width="33%">
        <img src="../../assets/images/Churros.JPG" alt="" width="33%">
    </div>
    <p>After that...</p>
    <h3>9:05 - 11:00</h3>
    <p>Yup, it took us around TWO more hours to get back home. I said it was an adventure, right? No? Well ,still, it is.</p>
    <p>And you may be wondering "How can you afford that? Public transport is expensive!!" Well... It isn't here, because as long as you do the require bus drives, it is free!</p>
    <p>(It does get expensive if you don't have the thing though)</p>
    <p>So that was my monday adventure getting bread, also, I hope you enjoyed meeting my sister, Fatima7732 (I'm using her minecraft username, even if her account was hacked)</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>I know this <i>Also</i> isn't much, but hey! Smaller and frequent is better than long and... Not frequent, so, I hope you enjoy these new styles! Let me know what you think!</p>
    <p>See you next time,</p>
    <p>- Fery</p>
