    <h1>Blog 26 (June 6th 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Monthly Update</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Howdy Everyone! Fery here, yet again, for a Monthly Update! Where I just post stuff that has happened!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Musical Adventures</h2>
    <p>So as you may know, I've got a <i>very</i> long history with music, given my family and such, so of course I'd have to try stuff like <i>music production</i> at
    some point, and in fact, I've been doing so! <i><b>Very heavily</b></i>, in fact.</p>
    <p>So of course, here's some of those tracks! All are OGGs so hopefully your browser can play them! If you can't then uh... i guess too bad, OGGs ftw</p>
    <h6>Note these all are <i>"covers"</i> of FNF songs since I suck at coming up with melodies</h6>
    <h3>DadFight - Fery Mix</h3>
    <p>This was, out of all 3, I think the second one I made? Most original too imo</p>
    <audio src="../../assets/music/DadFight.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
        Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
    </audio>
    <h3>High - Fery Mix</h3>
    <p>The first one out of it all! I've <i>always</i> wanted to do Mom mixes because god her songs scratch my brain. however my talent isn't there yet :(</p>
    <audio src="../../assets/music/High-FeryMix.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
        Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
    </audio>
    <h3>Lo-Fight - Fery Mix (Internally called Lo-Vibe)</h3>
    <p>A mod song? With the other two? It's more likely than you think. The latest one out of all 3!</p>
    <audio src="../../assets/music/Lo-Vibe.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
        Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
    </audio>

    <p>These are all done with FL Studio, a LOT of soundfonts, and just pain.</p>
    <p>By the way, the "Fery" chromatics are, well... Me! Here's the download to the .wv file for SliceX! Should be usable immediately in FL Studio</p>
    <p><a href="../../assets/music/FeryChromatic2.wv" download>Click me for a download!</a></p>
    <h6>github is gonna be so pissed about this lmfao</h6>

    <h2>Internships reaching the end</h2>
    <p>Yup, after nearly 3 months of internships (It's been almost 3 MONTHS??? WHAT???), I finish my internships on this Wednesday..! (Jun 11th)</p>
    <p>To be honest, I don't <i>really</i> want them to end, I love the place I work in, the stuff I do, and such! However, things must come to an end, and, well... Summer earlier sounds nice.</p>
    <p>Aside from that, not much more about them! I'm still not gonna disclose things about the place I've been working at, I'm just gonna say this place is very nice ^^</p>
    <p>Hopefully I'll be able to, as a last thing, take a picture with everyone to print and put in my board <3</p>

    <h3>Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4</h3>
    <p>So as you may know, last week, Chapters 3 & 4 of Deltarune released and... OH MY GOD.</p>
    <p>First off, I replayed Chapters 1 and 2 from scratch, just to have that save data for a normal playthrough (Most if not all recruits, and not much more)</p>
    <p>So starting Chapter 3 in the dark world, and... wow. Ralsei and Susie having a talk, just for FUCKING TENNA TO APPEAR AND DRAG US TO A SHOW</p>
    <p>Of course, in name input, I went with "KRS", just because I could. I didn't even realize it could be read as "KuRSe" and got confused as the joke, then realized.</p>
    <p>The gameplay was quite nice too, and it was really hilarious in every way. After the second board though, and the story picking up, I kinda... really hated the whole
    Tenna taking control part, and just being forced to battle and such, but after figuring out the shut down button thing, I felt so smart</p>
    <p>The gameplay, everything, felt amazing! Even the water cooler. The boss fight? Amazing? And the Knight? One shot me :3 And I have no shadow mantle.</p>
    <p>The whole shelter thing and everything, and the ending being THAT, just was like "OH MY GOD WHAT".</p>
    <p>As for Chapter 4, seeing Gerson I was like "excuse me what", because I <i>follow the lore</i> and seeing him there was something. I also heard Undyne's theme
    in his (or would it be the opposite?) and just imploded. Like the recognition was IMMEDIATE.</p>
    <p>THe lore, the battles, THE MUSIC, god I loved it all SO MUCH I just loved the both chapters.</p>
    <p>Also hearing Undertale Music in Deltarune made me go "OMG I KNOW THAT FROM UNDERTALE", lmfao</p>
    <p>As for the non dark world lore, ALSO AMAZING, and CAROL??????.</p>
    <p>Lastly, just to finish this before I just go insane, I just wanna say... i can't wait for the next chapters :sob:</p>

    <h2>Blog Updated</h2>
    <p>As you might have seen in this blog, and, honestly, everywhere else in the website, the blog got a small update!</p>
    <p>First off, the sidebar is no longer padded (or the entire body), so it is <i>endless</i> (hopefully)</p>
    <p>Along with that, we've got Windows 11's rounded corners! No more sharp squares, welcome to the rounded corner doom!... At least in the main divs</p>
    <p>I've yet to update everything to be more rounded, so for now, only the div i use for everything will have them!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>That's it for now!
    <br>See you next time, and remember, Stay Fresh! - Fery</p>
