    <h2>AKA : Monthly Update!</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Hi everyone! Fery here once again, for the Monthly Update!</p>
    <p>A LOT has happened, and I'd like to talk about it all, so let's get started with it!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Trips with mom</h2>
    <p>A few days ago (October 25th), me and my mom decided to take some trips in the bus! Mostly so she could finish her trips, and I could show her the
    "wonderful" world of buses. So, how'd it go? <br>...Incredibly well, actually.</p>
    <h3>First stop - Gluten Free Bakery</h3>
    <p>So our first stop was my favourite bakery, because it's gluten free! We left at ~7 AM in the morning, and arrived just a bit past 9 AM!</p>
    <p>That was already 3 bus trips! One from my town to the main terminal. One from the main terminal, to the 2nd terminal, and the last one, on the tram,
    just to walk less.</p>
    <p>After that, we simply continued onwards! We took the tram, then the bus back to the terminals, and we were off (After a bit of wait) to another city!</p>
    <p>This one is the one where there's a good chunk of stores, so we went window shopping, just looking at stuff! Until...</p>
    <h3>Not 2nd stop, the 4th actually - TechStore (big brand)</h3>
    <p>We went to a big tech store chain, just because to check some things. We were at another one before, but they didn't do a thing we needed, but on the next one...</p>

    <img src="../../assets/images/Switch2.jpg" width="40%" style="align-self: center;">
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>A Switch 2! Indeed, I managed to get one after some time! How? <br> Easy! My mom :3 <br> <h6>Basically she just went like "Sure I know you'll pay me
plus otherwise you might not get it ever so why not, plus it's your birthday and Christmas gift</h6></p>
    <p>So indeed, I am now the owner of a Switch 2! And <i>GOD</i> it's so much better than the Switch 1</p>
    <p>So far I only have my old Switch 1 games, but now I can do hilarious things like buying minecraft a 2nd time because I can't do local multiplayer with my sister</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Prideful Pridecraft</h2>
    <p>So, if you've seen the git channel in <a href="discord.pridecraft.gay">Pridecraft's Discord</a>, you'd see that I've been doing a bunch of work in Prideful!</p>
    <p>Of course, as of right now, work has... Kind of slowed down, mostly because classes are ramping up, and along with doctor's visits, I can't really afford to
    do pridecraft stuff in class (yet I can do a blog entry, since it's mostly typing!)</p>
    <p>While most textures are kind of done, a good bunch of other things are not done yet since I feel like I shouldn't close those (like License, Music, etc..),
    while other stuff is just blocked due to some features missing, like the panorama, so it's just kinda... mostly but not really done</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>School, school, school</h2>
    <p>So, after <a href="33.html">last blog</a>, you'd think I'd have nothing more to say about school, right?</p>
    <p>WRONG, but it isn't bad stuff!</p>
    <p>Mostly I just wanna talk about thinking on what's going on at class. Because GOD I did NOT think it'd be like THIS <br>
    First of all, the difficulty has ramped a bit in some subjects (Programming, mostly), and then there's my DB subject, where I understand NOTHING and still get
    passing grades somehow :sob:</p>
    <p>I'm also on hold for the convalidations still, but one of the classes I want to convalidate just went and said "Hey :) Exam every week starting next week", and...
    <br>I really don't wanna deal with that. <br>
    I <i>could</i> skip that class, but it'd leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, so I'd rather... not? But still I'm just not feeling up to dealing with that class,
    specially since it's kind of "filler"</p>
    <p>Aside from that though, every other class is fine, albeit some are more tiring, like <abbr title="Sistemas Informáticos (IT Systems)">SSF</abbr>, or
        <abbr title="Digitalización (Digitalization)">DJK</abbr>, mostly because they're filler (latter), or they just summarize what I did the last two years
    (former)</p>
    <p>Aside from that, everything is going well! If something notable related to classes happens, I'll make sure to update you ^^</p>

<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Cultural Pass!</h2>
    <p>So, since I'll be turning 18 soon (look at the next section to know when :3), I was able to (using my mom to represent me), request the "Cultural Pass"!</p>
    <p>What's a cultural pass? It's just a debit card the government gives people who are turning 18 this year for culture stuff! In specific, we get:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>200€ for "Cultural Events" (Movies, Theater, Etc..)</li>
        <li>100€ for Digital Purchases (Gift cards, mostly)</li>
        <li>100€ for Physical Goods (Books, CDs/DVDs, etc...)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But of course, it comes with <i>a caveat</i> at the very least. Which is the fact that the only stores available are the ones that request it via paperwork,
    and the government accepts. So for example, a cinema closer to my home isn't available, so I have to take two buses to the 2nd nearest, which is further away.</p>
    <p>There's also the fact that 50% of the money is stuck in a category that most people never use, except for rare occasions, so that sucks, but oh well</p>
    <p>The good thing is... I got Deltarune for free :3c (LEGALLY)</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2><i>Ink</i>oming Birthday</h2>
    <h3>yes i made the pun obvious</h3>
    <p>So, if some of you aren't aware, for... some reason??, my birthday is this Saturday! (The 8th!), it's one of the rare times it has lined up with a weekend, which
    makes it great to go out with my friends! (and sister)</p>
    <p>We'll probably go to the cinema, even if the one I can pay with the "Cultural Pass" is a fuckton away, compared to the other one.</p>
    <p>Also <i>Also</i>, I'm turning 18! I'll be legal :3 So I'm planning on making a new account for my.. Non SFW tastes. I'll talk about it in my
    normal bluesky, and if any minors roam around <i>that</i> one, I'll nuke them. (As in block them, I don't wanna get in trouble because of that!)</p>
    <p>I also gotta do a LOT of paperwork to get my electronic ID sorted out, so I can do stuff more easily</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>DiscoverEU-ing</h2>
    <p>So, as I'm turning 18, I can ALSO request the DiscoverEU pass! Which, if I get, means I'll be doing an "EU Tour" to meet some people I know online!</p>
    <p>I won't state who yet, but I'll make sure to post pictures, with their consent, of course ^^</p>
    <p>I've got 3 countries in mind, and since it's 99% trains, I'll have to deal with those for the first time ever! (Lovely)</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>GregTech-ing it in New Horizons</h2>
    <p><s>does this make me straight now</s> - no it actually makes me gayer</p>
    <p>So I don't know if I've ever said it here, but slowly I've been getting an interest on GregTech New Horizons (GTNH), and well...</p>
    <p>I joined a server to play it more than in Singleplayer (I HATE SINGLEPLAYER)</p>
    <p>So the server is actually from a person I met online like, over a year ago. He originally had only a Forge 1.20.1 Create server, with a bunch of addons! So I found
    it, and started playing in it! Eventually, A 2nd, then 3rd "season" were made, and I just played on them every so often (Like, very sparingly), until a few days ago!</p>
    <p>I was just scouring the Discord server, when I found a new "GTNH" category, and apparently there'd been a HUGE SPIKE in players, with LOTS of people joining
    in the past few days. I managed to make it very early in the server's life, a few days only! Which meant I got to start quick enough!</p>
    <p>And I'm starting the Steam Age (soon), just not now since well.. I am quite occupied :3'</p>
    <p>I even got a new teammate! ^^</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>So, that's about it for this month! I'm sorry for the delays, but as you can see, a LOT has happened</p>
    <p>See you next time, next month, or earlier, probably!</p>
