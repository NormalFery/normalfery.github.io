    <h1>Blog 32 (September 29nd 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Back into routine!</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Hi everyone! Fery here once again, for a blog entry!</p>
    <p>I'll be talking mostly about my routine and such, because wow, that's a thing now for me</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Routines - Daily ones</h2>
    <p>So of course, before anything, I have a "daily routine" that I do Mon-Fri, becuase of school! In specific, I,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wake up (At 5:45 AM)</li>
        <li>Get ready (Shower, getting dressed, breakfast)</li>
        <li>Leave my home at ~6:45-ish AM (Yes, getting ready and such takes me an hour)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After that, I go to a friend's home, and wait until ~7:15-ish AM, and from there his mom takes me to school! (Otherwise I'd be taking the bus WAY
    earlier.</p>
    <p>While on the road, with the traffic, we just listen to the radio to try and win a contest (Still on it!)</p>
    <p>After that, I simply do my classes as normal, starting at 8 AM and finishing at 2 PM, and from there</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I take the Tram to the Terminal (14:15-ish to 14:30-ish?)</li>
        <li>I go from the lowest floor of the terminal to the highest one, and take the bus (@ 14:40 PM)</li>
        <li>I arrive at my town after 15:00 PM, and get home ~10 minutes later by walking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From there, I eat lunch and depending on the day, do different things</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>The Exceptions</h2>
    <h3>Language School</h3>
    <p>So I'm getting my C1 English Degree, and that means 2 years of language school! 2 hours, 2 days a week, starting at 7-ish PM,
    and finishing at 9:30-ish PM. Of course that means those two days I</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrive from school after 3 PM</li>
        <li>Finish lunch at 4 PM-ish (give or take)</li>
        <li>Lay down on bed to rest a bit (Like an hour or so? Not napping though!)</li>
        <li>Leave at 6:30-ish PM (a bit earlier sometimes), to take the bus to ANOTHER city</li>
        <li>Arrive at the new city at ~7:00 PM to walk to language school with barely enough time</li>
        <li>Exit the language school 2 hours later, and get picked up by my dad to go home! (and SLEEP)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Driving School</h3>
    <p>So of course, I ALSO have Driving school, but it's once a week, on Wednesday, which does mean... More doing stuff</p>
    <p>However it's closer to my home, so I leave around the same time as language school, and get home only an hour later, which works
    wonders for me since I can go to the grocery store if I need anything as well!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>So yeah, that's about it for my schedule, at least for now. The second I get my theory exam done, and start driving around, It'll probably change</p>
    <p>I also didn't talk about much about what I do on weekends, or on Monday/Friday, but that's because I don't have a routine for those days,
    I like to rest you know!!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Asides from that, see you all next time!</p>
