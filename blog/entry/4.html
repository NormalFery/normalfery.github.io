        <p>Hi everyone! I told you in the <a href=3.html>last blog</a> that I'd be back when Side Order released, and it did!... <b>at one in the fucking morning</b> so... Yeah.</p>
        <p>Ironically enough, I went to sleep early, woke up at 1 AM, and then just played until 4 AM, finishing it! It was... amazing. I loved it.</p>
        <p>I could be an asshole and just spoil it all, but I won't! But still,</p>
        <p><b>DISCLAIMER : SPOILERS AHEAD</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>With that covered, what have I done so far in Side order?</p>
        <p>Well, I :</p>
        <ul class="notnavbar">
            <li><p>Finished the main story <b>With the Order Dualies</b> (because no way I was using something else)</p></li>
            <li><p>Also ran another 30 floors with the Splattershot (I actually did like, 58)</p></li>
            <li><p>I got many upgrades</p></li>
            <li><p>And I just decided that I can't do more because my switch is low in battery</p></li>
        </ul>  
        <p>Now you may think : "You did all that in 3 hours????"</p>
        <p><b>No. I am not a masochist</b></p>
        <p>Instead, I just went to school, brought my switch, and used the first 2 class periods for playing it (That's when I got the Splattershot and some other upgrades)</p>
        <p>So yeah, aside from that, time for the second part "School Boredom"</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>This sounds like a first world problem but.... School is too boring. I don't mean it in a "I don't like school ew it's boring" kind of way, but in a "I have no fucking work to do and my class is too slow" way, which you know... Sucks. I am forced to follow their rhythm all year, and I'm stuck just not busy in class (That's how this blog started)</p>
        
        <p>So yeah, it's a pain. But still, at least when I do get new work to do, I can just do that quickly and good!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Welp, that was everything for now! See you when I unlock all other Side order weapons (jk it'll be sooner)!</p>
