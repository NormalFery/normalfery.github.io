  <h1>Blog 28 (July 8th 2025)</h1>
  <h2>AKA : Monthly Update!</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <p>Howdy Everyone! Fery here, once more, for a monthly update, to cover June, and July! There's a lot to cover, so let us get started!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2> Graduating, Enrollment Scares, and more</h2>
  <p>So first off, let's talk about school! In my case, it went pretty well! I graduated <i>with honors</i>, top of the class, and started summer on <b>the 17th</b> officially.
  <br><br>
    Everything seemed great! I was top of the class, first one in line to the thing I want to study next year, when suddenly, when trying to enroll myself at the end of June (think around the 25th-ish),
    I see THIS when trying to check if I was enrolled or not</p>
  <div class="images">
    <img src="../../assets/images/ohgodwhy.png">
  </div>
  <p>Yup, as you can see (censored the center names, because yes.), I was in the "Excluded" list in ALL 3 SPOTS (distributed among 2
  different centers) because I had "No grade certificate submitted or I hadn't completed my studies" which... I call bullshit, a lot.

  <br><br>So, armed with my Mom, and some time before the deadline (Today's the deadline, by the way! :3), we headed to the school to be like
  "yo wtf why did this happen" and apparently <i>I wasn't the only one</i>, and the Goverment (take into account, this is a public school) had
    an "oopsie" and they just casually erased the grades of most if not all kids that were in a <a href="../../schoolguide.html">"Medium Vocational Grade"</a>, which, DAMN. That's a lot of people.</p>
  <p>So I had to fill in (more like give my mom to fill in because my handwriting is shit) papers manually and go in another day to give them the BIG A4 SIZE ENVELOPE (I think it was probably closer to like 2.5/4s of an A3?)
  with all the documentation. We did so, and then... Boom. I was finally enrolled for next year. Yippie! :3</p>
  <p>Along with that, later on the week, I got a notification from my Language School, to enroll (I was a late enrollment because my mom decided to enroll me later on), so I did the paperwork with mom, signed stuff ,and now I'm enrolled for starting my C1.1 this year!</p>
  <p>Yes. I have a B2. I'm getting the C1.</p>

<div class="bodies">
  <h2>More and More and More Music!</h2>
  <p>Yes, I have done more music behind the scenes! So here's some of my best picks for this round of "Fery's Music"!</p>
  <h3>Spookeez  - Fery Mix</h3>
  <p>Definitively a Mix. I don't really like it much, but it's good, better than other things</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/Spooked.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
  </audio>
  <h3>Tutorial - Fery Mix</h3>
  <p>Of course, like usual, a Tutorial mix! This one comes with a bit of improv, and more instruments, along with bongos, because who doesn't like those?</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/Tutorial.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
  </audio>
  <h3>Vs Creatives!Fery</h3>
  <p>A mostly original song? Yup! This one is a kind of "Versus Me" theme, made to try and not think much about editing videos, which I HAVE TO DO AT SOME POINT</p>
  <audio src="../../assets/music/VsFery.ogg" type="audio/ogg" controls>
    Whoops! Seems you CAN'T play oggs, sorry :(
  </audio>

  <p>Of course, we have the magic of the amen break on the last one, a lot of care too, hope you all like them! And along with that..</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>New Music Section! (And More Refactoring)</h2>
  <p>Yup! Since I don't really have any good place to put my music in, I decided to just put them in a place for everyone check!</p>
  <p>I don't <i>really have a license</i> thought out for these tracks for now, though, but <a href="../../music/music.html">do check up on it so you can see all tracks!</a></p>
  <p>I also did some more cleanup work, putting files like images, videos (if I ever do those), CSS, and others in a new "assets" folder! Definitively better for me!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>Bucket List? Check!</h2>
  <p>Yup, this update adds not <i>one</i>, but <b><i>TWO</i></b> new pages! Talk about big! I'm talking about the new <a href="../../bucket-list.html">Bucket List</a> page!</p>
  <p>Ever wanted to see what I want to do before I <i>"turn 30 or die"</i> in my own past self words? (I did it on a slow morning at work!)</p>
  <p>Welp, there you go! Spy up on everything I've done, and just enjoy!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>Future Shenanigans</h2>
  <p>Of course, given my busyness (business? I'm unsure x,p) and such, you may think "Oh, what about this website?", well, given how it's my little spot in the internet...</p>
  <p>It won't go anywhere! And as long as GitHub doesn't try suing me for using it to host my music as well, enjoy using it! ^^</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <p>Well, that's it for now! I don't have much more to say except...</p>
  <p>Don't touch that Dial! - Fery</p>
