    <h1>Blog 36 (December 18th 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Monthly Update</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Howdy everyone! Fery here with yet another <i>monthly update</i>!</p>
    <p>Given it is December, and the holidays are near, well... why not do a monthly update now?</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Social Shenanigans (for MRCL)</h2>
    <p>Soo a little thing that happened shortly after the last blog update (Nov 16th to be exact)... <br>
    I became part of MRCL's social media team! (Which exists because of another friend) So... What have I done so far?</p>
    <p>Not much. Just a few images. It's kind of the best I can do without having to dedicate so much time I'll burn out, but also lets me do
    fun stuff like text! I've done promo images for both <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrcl.cc/post/3m6rurer32s2n">The 1.21(.8) update</a>, and the
        <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrcl.cc/post/3m7shxepfdc2f">Return of the arcade!</a></p>
    <p>I also have some <i>scraps</i>, but I have no idea if I can post those :3 I'll probably ask and will show them next time, or even do a page dedicated
    to them!</p>
    <p>If you are curious, I do most stuff in <i>Photoshop</i> (pirated, because fuck Adobe), and use Flashback for taking images (NO YOU SHOULD NOT USE IT
    IN THE SERVER)</p>
    <p>If you want to see more stuff, why not check out <a href="https://discord.mrcl.cc">MRCL'S Discord</a>? It's a pretty nice place :3</p>

    <h2>Grades, school, and shenanigans</h2>
    <p>So with this being the last week of classes this year, of course grades are coming out, and I passed all my classes for this trimester! With very good
    grades too..</p>
    <p>Aside from that though, It indeed has been a very nice school year so far, even if some clases are just rehashes of stuff I've learnt before.</p>
    <p>I do have to get a grade back up, on my databases class, because WOW I THOUGHT I FAILED BUT I DIDN'T HOLY</p>
    <p>But yes, it's been a very pleasant year in my normal school</p>
    <h3>English C1 Classes</h3>
    <p>As for the C1 however...</p>
    <p>Also very good, very high grades, I still suck at reading (I'M AN UNDERTALE FAN) and got only a 7.5/10 (9s in everything else btw), and then
    had to do a little act for the school's Cultural Journeys thing they do in December. It was nice though, and I did my best! I <i>would</i> upload
    the video here but privacy concerns and such make me kinda iffy in doing it</p>
    <h3>Driving School</h3>
    <p>I have a date for my theory exam</p>
    <p>It's on early January. I have to miss class to go do the exam.</p>
    <p>I am a <i>bit</i> nervous but I'm also confident! I just wanna do it quickly so I can finally start doing driving practices</p>
    <p>I'll warn you when I do a practice so you can stay home and avoid being ran over the teenager</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Scholarship Shenanigans</h2>
    <p>Yup, I got my scholarship! And I've already got a huge chunk of it saved up for the DiscoverEU trip (I'll talk more about it once it's finished)</p>
    <p>As for what I've gotten with it so far</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2020 iPad Air (+ Gen 2 Apple Pencil (and Temu case))</li>
        <li>Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 Pro 5G (To match with sister - can't actually use it until Jan 6th)</li>
        <li>Switch 2 (Mom paid for it originally, I paid her because it was part of the agreement)</li>
        <li>Hytale</li>
        <li>Procreate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And many other things I may have forgotten or not. Of course that wasn't <i>All of the money</i> I used, I put a good chunk into savings for the DEU trip!</p>
    <p>I would've spent another 65 for a certain <i>someone</i> to be with me this week but... He didn't want to and I wasn't gonna make him</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Pridecraft Shenanigans</h2>
    <h3>Pridepack</h3>
    <p>Pridepack is now on v11! I didn't do much for the update since school has just kinda taken me hostage</p>
    <p>There's also Allypack, a new helper datapack for new features, without needing to replace more vanilla things!</p>
    <h3>Allypack</h3>
    <p>i haven't even touched it</p>
    <h3>PrideGUI</h3>
    <p>So funny story. Mojang sucks at naming things, and the old pre resource pack texture pack format is a PAIN</p>
    <p>I have yet to fix stuff, which are in issues in GitHub, and will require the next Legacy release to have a new split due to the Creative menu</p>
    <p>So Expect a Legacy 3.1.0 update to fix like everything regarding that (Light Mode included)</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Other things</h2>
    <p>So as for the last part of this blog, I just wanted to say... <b>Thank you</b> for being here and reading!</p>
    <p>This blog has come quite far from its original, Times New Roman in a white page start, and its unsplit CSS, along with no JS</p>
    <p>I know most people don't really read these blogs, but to the few that do, I'm really glad you do, and wish you a Merry Christmas</p>
    <p><b>Thank you for reading</b></p>
