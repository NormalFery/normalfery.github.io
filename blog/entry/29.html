  <h1>Blog 29 (July 16th 2025)</h1>
  <h2>AKA : Website Updates!</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <p>Howdy Everyone! Fery back here, for big announcements about the website! Because "FerySite 2", as I'm calling it, is <i>almost entirely</i>
  feature complete! You might know some of these things already if you follow my bluesky, but even then, here's more
    of my insight! Ready? Yes? Then lets get started!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>Navbar changes</h2>
  <p>Yup! Believe it or not, the navbar has changed! Alongside new buttons, the way the navbar is handled in code is different too!</p>
  <p>If you want to skip the technical part, <a href="#notech1">click me</a> for the TL;DR! Otherwise, go on!</p>
  <p>So pretty much, what I've done (with some help from, NOT AI, but google), specifically taking code from
  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_include.asp">this "HowTo"</a>from W3 Schools, I made it so instead of each page
  having a single navbar that HAS to be changed in EVERY page to avoid outdated pages, I only have to change 3 html files! One for each "level"
  Blogs (and Memories) use the deepest level, while the index uses the surface one!</p>
  <p id="notech1">TL;DR: now each page just calls an html file, and a new js script makes it appear.</p>
  <p>I may not have written the code itself, but troubleshooting it was painful enough. I will probably reuse the script but for other things
  in the future! Maybe make the "head" part of the page also different? (Except title and color CSS)</p>

  <p>Talking about CSS...</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>CSS "Splits"</h2>
  <p>After a <i>LONG</i> time of keeping most of the CSS the same, big as fuck files, I finally decided to use <b>variables</b>
  for the CSS instead! Now you are loading "main.css", which gives the structure, and "theme.css", which gives the page the color
  it needs!</p>
  <p>This way, if I need to fix a div, or a grid, I don't need to do it ALL 5 TIMES for themes, and theme implementations are now easier!</p>
  <p>If you wanna add your own theme to the site, feel free to do a PR! Just take a look at the theme files and change the colors around ^^</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>Grids? Grids. Grids!</h2>
  <p>If you've been to the <a href="../../music/music.html">music page</a> recently, you might've seen the newer style!</p>
  <p>This is all thanks to <i>CSS Grids</i> and a lot of pain! And it was worth it! Now we have 3 songs per row, since that's what I usually
  drop in each blog entry!</p>
  <p>I will try to update it every so often without depending on blog entries though, so make sure to check them!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>Page Merging, Changes, and more</h2>
  <p>After a <i>lot</i> of thinking, I decided to do a move to make the site have... "less" pages. How? By merging them!</p>
  <p>This was done with,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Blog & Memories Pages (made into a single <a href="../blog.html">blog page</a>)</li>
    <li>The "Who", "Where", and "Projects" page, made into a single <a href="../../who.html">"About Me" page</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These pages also use CSS Grid! The Blog and Memories Pages uses it to split the lists into the Blog and Memory Sections, while the
  "About Me" (internally called "who.html" by the way), uses it for 3 "bullet points" that answer the questions easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <h2>The future of my website</h2>
  <p>As I've said before (and proved given the BIG update I've been doing for a while now), I <i>don't plan on abandoning this website</i>
  , even if GitHub eventually decides to remove it and make me move, or I do it myself willingly, this website will <i>not</i> be going
   away ever. <br><br>I also don't plan on abandoning it either. While updates might be slow, there are still things I want to do, like a
  gallery for all photos in the website, or maybe even share it with my partner!</p>
  <p>All in all, if anyone reads this, and actually cares about this site, don't worry. It will not be leaving anytime soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
  <p>With all that being said, this was quite a big update!</p>
  <p>I'll see you guys next time, probably next month! - Fery.</p>
