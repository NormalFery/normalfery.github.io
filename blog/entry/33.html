    <h1>Blog 33 (October 23rd - 29th 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Convalidation Shenanigans</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Hi everyone! Fery here once again, for a small, very postponed blog post</p>
    <p>There's mostly one thing to talk about, but given it's been ~1 month since I did my last update, I'd rather just get it done with</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Unconvalidated Convalidations</h2>
    <p>So, as you may know, I'm doing "Superior Vocational School" currently, to expand my knowledge, and not be 17 and do nothing. Of course, that
    does bring one new thing I can do! Good old <i>convalidations</i>.</p>
    <p>For those who may not know, or if my mindless translation is wrong, a convalidation is a way to "pass" a subject without doing it, by
    already having done it before, or having the same knowledge as it (Without an exam). <br>
    For example, my <i>certified</i> B2 in English allows me to convalidate my English class, so once it's processed, I just don't have that subject anymore!</p>
    <p>If only it was that simple though.</p>
    <h3>September 22nd 2025</h3>
    <p>I give my paperwork to the head teacher of my class, so he can forward it to the Secretary's Office, so I can convalidate English and "ITK",
    sounds good, right? I thought so too for ~a month, since they don't process anything until the time ends for the presentation.</p>
    <h3>October 20th 2025</h3>
    <p>I'm outside school, heading to take the tram, when I get an <i>Unknown Call</i> to my phone, and I pick it up. It was the school! They told me
    "Hey this paperwork is wrong, you have to get the same thing from the EOI (Official School of Languages) instead of from your high school", and I'm like
    "Oh okay! ^^", and so I decide to go to the EOI the next day.</p>
    <h3>October 21st 2025</h3>
    <p>I head to the EOI with my dad, mostly so I don't have to take the 30 minute bus back and forth, and I ask over there "Hey can I get xyz paper
    from here since I can't have it from my high school?" And I get told "Nope, since you weren't our student, you can't get it, we can get you
    a certificate that we're processing your title and such though" and I'm like "Sure, how much is it?", it's like under 5â‚¬ so I decide "I'll ask my school if that'd work!"
    and go home after a bit</p>
    <h3>October 22nd 2025</h3>
    <p>I asked my school via email "Hey does xya paper work for convalidating?" And they're like "Yeah sure, since it's gonna take a bit, you can also just
    send us the Model 700 instead" and I'm like "That's nice", so I pay for the certificate, send proof of payment to the EOI, and to the Secretary's Office, and
    just after a bit... <br>
    <i>"Hey so uh this is the wrong paper."</i> <br>
    And that's where I started getting annoyed. Quite a bit, in fact. I emailed them back like "Hey, so I asked for xya, and you said I could send Model 700, and I did.
    What's the one I need to send?????" and I?m still waiting for a response. Here's why I'm even madder, though.
    <br><b>They called me just before 12 PM</b>. I was IN CLASS at the time, with my phone OBVIOUSLY in silent mode, and I didn't realize until my phone
    vibrated from a spam call nearly an hour later. Of course after seeing the number that called me before the spam one I was like "Hm, I should probably call it
    back". I called twice and got no answer. AT ALL.</p>
    <h3>October 27th 2025</h3>
    <p>After some thinking, I finally went to the secretary's office, and was like "Hey WHAT do I give you???" and after some talking, she told me what it was!</p>
    <p>It was the Model 700, just a different one.</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>So yup, it's been quite a few weeks, expect a Blog 34 sooner than later though!</p>
    <p>See you next time!</p>
