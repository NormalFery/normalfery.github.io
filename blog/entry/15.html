        <h1>Blog 15th (June 16th 2024)</h1>
        <h2>AKA: Summer is here! Yippie!</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <p>Yup, that's true, it's been here for nearly 7 days, and I wanted to write a bit about everything I've got planned, along with some extra things that have somehow managed to happen in the last... 6 days? Wow, it's still a bit, so get ready!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">    
        <h2>Beta Testing... how?</h2>
        <p>So by now you guys know I love getting into things like... I don't know how to call them exactly, "Shenanigans" maybe? Not really... Well into funny situations, to call it in a way. Well that happened a few days ago!</p>
        <p>To be exact, June 13th (So 3 days ago), I was seeing two of my "friends" (I consider them friends, I have <b>No idea</b> if they consider me friends though, not gonna risk them seeing this in like, 2 months and just being like "We're not friends we're acquaintances" or something similar (Yes this is my self doubt or anxiety coming at me haha help.)</p>
        <p>And well I was just "imagine if I could join" (I have the beta server's address due to previous beta testing) and then one of them said "Go ahead" and I went like "Yeah I imagined this would happen" and after that, he just went "oh I thought you were whitelisted" And just... Turned off whitelist and later on, in the stream (Discord stream btw) he just whitelisted me, yes I saw it.</p>
        <p>So like, now I'm the server but I can't see the new stuff since there's no pack uploaded to it, and I don't have a local copy. They come in clutch again and send me a mediafire link and go like "Don't leak it or I'll kill you" and I was like "I wont qwq" (I don't have anybody that would even <b>care</b> about it.</p>
        <p>So now I can see the stuff, and they were showing it to me, and it's got to the point where now I can just join and be like "hoi" and just... Play around with the new stuff and I'm surprised that the Owner hasn't said anything to them. Hell even some of the other admins are like "sure why not" and I mean- it's cool??? I'm just scared I'll get in trouble</p>
        <p>Well, aside from that... What's more to say? Hm... Oh yeah!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bodies">
        <h2>Coding a Minecraft Plugin sucks, proceed with caution</h2>
        <p>So yeah, I tried to code a Minecraft plugin, no, I'm not kidding. I went from Python to HTML to Java, and immediately went back to the other two.</p>
        <p>So what did I try to do? Add a simple /heal command following a tutorial.</p>
        <p>What happened? ... The console spit a thousand errors (Okay maybe like, 20 but still) and I straight up can't fix it</p>
        <p>First it spit a weird error, turns out a file was not in the right place, I move it</p>
        <p>Now console spits a thousand other errors, yippie</p>
        <p>I check stuff, it looks correct. I keep checking stuff, It still looks correct, so I go "I'll try with a fabric mod!"</p>
        <p>Now I have an error saying "This version of loom does not support the mixin remap value" I just slam my head against my head and go "Fuck it I'm sticking with console python programs" So... Yup, that's where I am right now haha.</p>
        <p>In any case, I feel like my main trait has to be some shit like <span style="color:#FF0000"><b>Determination</b></span> or <span style="color:#892bc9"><b>Perseverance</b></span> because I am NOT giving up no matter what</p>
        <p>I am straight up determined to make it work, and make my bf happy with a mod he might like with custom potion effects and oh my god I am doing this just for him so much I just fucking love him</p>
        <p>So yeah... But there's more!</p>

        <h2>More Clancy Loving</h2>
        <h3>Proceed with caution, here things are wayyy too much about lovey dovey stuff and trust me this might be the longest thing yet.</h3>
        <p>So basically, I just love my boyfriend a lot, really</p>
        <p>I've said this exact same thing thousands of times, over and over again, but I can't stop, and won't stop! I fucking love him a lot! He's my boyfriend, he's the best, he treats me nice, we do stuff together, we play Minecraft together, I just love him a lot, and I can NOT stop thinking about him</p>
        <p>Not only that, he's also just the bestest, most amazing boyfriend ever, like... He pays for our minecraft server and stuff, and like, ajoisnarfiosng I just love him a lot</p>
        <p>I also know he wouldn't leave me, we've got "plans" for the future (AKA: Meeting up sometime in our lives), and like, I know it'll happen, I'm <span style="color:#FF0000">Determined</span> for it to happen NO MATTER WHAT. Like, idc if I have to go over there and survive the foreign language, I'll do it just for him</p>
        <p>He also does way more for me, and I just wish I could pay him back but it's kinda hard since well... I got no job or a way to get one, because I'm still studying, so.. Yeah</p>
        <p>I also love his humor, his personality, his.... everything!!! God he's just the best partner anyone could ask for, like, I feel so lucky we've been so well even seeing <a href="../memory/memory1.html">how we met</a> some time ago now... Wow nearly 4 years? That's more than my previous relationship!... and my only other relationship.</p>
        <p>So yeah, Clancy section is over, and with this, so is the entire blog post!</p>
