    <h1>Blog 30 (August 17th 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Monthly Update!</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Howdy everyone! Fery here once again for another Monthly-ish update, but also... <br>
    <b>Happy Blog Entry number 30!</b><br> Yup, that's right, this is the 30th blog entry I write ^^ It's been <i>quite a while</i> since I started
    working on the website, but it feels like everything's changed so fast! Thank you for being with me, and reading these updates! <br> Now...
    Let's get started!</p>

<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Wisdom Pains</h2>
    <p>This is the most recent part, but... one of my wisdom teeth is KILLING me right now. I'm talking full on "I can't smile OR EVEN YAWN because I'll die"
    kind of pain. <br>I might sound like a crybaby, but I am serious, this is just killing me right now and I wanna cry because OW WHY ME :sob:</p>
    <p>Worst thing is I had a lesser version of it a few days ago, and now it's back and it is taking revenge on me</p>

    <h2>Walking, Hiking, Leg cramps the following day</h2>
    <h6>-# that's a reference to the family guy meme with rearranging furniture</h6>
    <p>So last Wednesday (13th) I had an outing with some friends, and we did a LOT of stuff, I'm talking full on entire day outing, I wasn't home until 8-9 PM!
    <br><br>We did a lot of stuff though! We went to big city 2 (2nd big city where I lived) and went hiking!...
    <br>and we passed quite literally IN FRONT of my Grandma's house, so I had to visit her (And luckily they waited for me ^^), note that we already had
    been walking for a while, from the bus station to there, which is a good walk, and uphill, but we did an EVEN HIGHER HIKE through a path which was...<br><br>
    quite embarrassing to do because I was the SLOWEST one out of all of them and they kept waiting for me they were just so sweet i just aodgoanmfjgoa</p>
    <p>REGARDLESS after that, we got to the top of the hill, and I took some pictures! I do have some more with all of them but due to privacy concerns
    and such I'd rather not add those (Even with explicit consent from them)</p>

<div class="bodies">
    <p>After that, we passed a few other places, and got back to the bus station! Then we had a picnic at the Big City, and after that, went back
    to our hometown! We went to a beach that was... quite further than expected, and, after that... We finished by eating dinner together at a restaurant! <br><br>
    While there, one of our friends said something along the lines of going from being on a hill at like 12 PM to eating dinner together in a restaurant and...<br><br>
    That IS true, quite hilarious, honestly. Afterwards we split the bill depending on what each person bought, and went home!</p>
    <p>It was quite a fun day, honestly, and it was worth getting painful leg cramps for the following day! Better than my wisdom tooth problem</p>

    <h2>Smartphone? I'd rather NOT</h2>
    <p>So a few days ago I was like "damn wouldn't a flip phone be better than a smartphone" and alas, I got one eventually! <br><br>
    It's a Nokia 2660 Flip, and god it's so good. It has 4G, a browser that can search google, and... That's about it. It has a camera, but I like my
    3DS more for that, and a flashlight, along with being able to play MP3s, WAV files, and MIDIs! (Not even modern phones can play MIDIs by default), and..
    That's about it! I did have to play around with the settings a bit so my SIM Card could use data, but that's fixed! ^^</p>
    <p>And you may be thinking "But what about texting??" Well... my SIM Card has unlimited SMSes! Of course people can't text back if they don't but
    it's still fine!</p>
    <p>I just love the flip phone so much :3</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Well, I don't have much more to say, but it has been a long time! A year and a half-ish since I started the blog just to do something in class
    while bored, and look at me! Now I do it at home to complain about pain!</p>
    <p>Aside from that... Thank you so much for being here with me, and see you next time!</p>
    <p>- Fery</p>
