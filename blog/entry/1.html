            <p>Hi everyone! I'm Fery (I feel like I've written that way more than I know I have), and welcome to my first blog entry!</p>
            <p>To begin, I wanna say that working on this was so difficult, and I couldn't have done it without my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/clancyboyo.bsky.social">Awesome Boyfriend</a> helping me with understanding html</p>
            <p>I also wanna warn everyone that 99% of Blog entries will have "Gay rambling" section where it's me just talking about Clancy</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bodies">
            <p>Anyway, aside from that,</p>
            <h3>What's new?</h3>
            <p>Well... A lot!</p>
            <p>First off, I made this site, and finished the first part, with all pages</p>
            <p>Then, I wrote this blog entry</p>
            <p>And hopefully, by the time this is written, the site works 100%!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bodies">
            <p>Aside from that... There isn't that much more to see, thanks for reading!</p>
            <p>See you all the next time I have something significant!</p>
