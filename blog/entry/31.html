    <h1>Blog 31 (September 22nd 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : Monthly Update!</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Hi everyone! Fery here once again, for another <b>monthly update!</b></p>
    <p>This one has taken a bit to do, due to a LOT of things that have happened, so here we go!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>School ramping back up</h2>
    <p>So, as I may have said before, I am going to school in the big city, so... I started last week! And honestly my routine has been quite a pain</p>
    <p>So I wake up at like, 5:45 AM, not to take a bus, but so I can be ready to go to school! <br>
    After that, I simply go out at around like, 6:45-ish AM, and get to a friend's house before 7:15, why?
    <br>Because his mom works at my school, so she brings me with her to avoid the bus :3</p>
    <p>Of course, that's just on the way in, on the way out I depend on public transport, so I take a tram, that's very filled, then
     take a bus home, and... Get home at like 15:20... (School finishes at 2 PM), and after that... I'm home!</p>
    <p>Unless it's a tuesday or thursday. In THOSE days, I get home at 15:20, then get to rest maybe a bit, if I don't have schoolwork, and then at 6,
    I don't eat dinner, I leave to take ANOTEHR bus to LANGUAGE SCHOOL to get my C1! After that, I leave at like, 9-ish PM, and just have to find
    a way home by bus, or get my dad to pick me up</p>
    <p>So yes, I'm gonna have a blast.</p>

    <h2>Wisdom Pains, the second</h2>
    <p>So as you may know, from the <a href="30">last blog entry</a>, I've entered the age where my wisdom teeth have started showing up. Of course,
    that meant dealing with the pain. Now I've gone to the dentist, and I've (finally) got a date to have an X-Ray of my mouth to see how my teeth will
    come, and... One of the tooth came in while I was awake at 12 AM. That was nice to deal with.</p>
    <p>So far, after that 2nd one, nothing else has happened, and I'm going on nicely, without any problems.</p>

<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Clancy-maxxing</h2>
    <p>So as you may know, I have a partner / boyfriend / at this point husband ngl</p>
    <p>And as you may know, he lives VERY far from me. Or the other way around, but regardless, he's mine.</p>
    <p>Of course, I wanna be able to talk to him face to face, kiss him, and more, but of course, distance makes that a bit hard</p>
    <p>So I'm gonna go <s>kidnap him</s> visit him sometime next year. <br>I've been planning it, and if I plan everything correctly, I can use part of
    my scholarship (They don't care what we do with the money! Just that we pass! x3) and go visit him :3</p>
    <p>While I still don't have the scholarship (ofc), I've already got dates, times, and such planned out already! All I need is the money and some more things</p>
    <p>It <i>does suck</i> for my D&D Campaigns, and while I could do them while there, It might be a bit weird...</p>
    <p>but yes i'll be kissing and cuddling him a lot :3c</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>So that's it for now! Not a big update, but maybe in Christmas I can push a big update!</p>
    <p>See you next time! -Fery</p>
