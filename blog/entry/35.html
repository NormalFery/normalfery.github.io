    <h1>Blog 35 (November 10th 2025)</h1>
    <h2>AKA : (Late) Birthday blog!</h2>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>Hi everyone! Fery here for a new blog entry!</p>
    <p>This will be more on the smaller side, as it's just about one day, November 8th, my birthday!</p>
    <p>So let us get started!</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Morning - Paperwork Runs</h2>
    <p>So I wake up on the early morning, around 7 AM (It was a Saturday, I wanted to sleep more, but nooo), and decide "hey..
    ..what if I opened a second bank account", and indeed, now that I'm 18 (Legal Adult), I was able to do so easily! Perhaps...
    too easily. Though, that doesn't mean it was th end of the paperwork</p>
    <p>Of course, I already had another bank account, opened by my mom (because I told her if she could do it), and that one was
    now in my name too... I also had to verify my identity on that one.</p>
    <p>It wasn't <i>too</i> bad, I just had to take a photo of my ID from the front and back, and then just a video with me saying my name,
    and showing it front and back, but...</p>
    <p>I had to do it FOUR. SEPARATE. TIMES. And of course my money was being gatekept by that, so I was quite annoyed and tired. I
    <i>did manage</i> to get it back in time, but still, that was a <i>lovely</i> start for my birthday.</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Bluesky.. For grownups</h2>
    <p>So along with that, I was also finishing a little thing I worked on during the week leading up to my birthday, an alt for myself...</p>
    <p><b>A NSFW ACCOUNT</b></p>
    <p>Of course, it IS meant to be for adults. You can find more information in my
        <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/normalfery.es">SFW, usual, still used, literally my default account</a>. I will just say that
    PLEASE, to ANY MINORS viewing this blog. <b>DO NOT GO TO IT.</b> I did block a few people, (even grown-ups I know personally for reasons)</p>
    <p>Aside from that, it still feels weird having that option. I have spent pretty much all my life being like "hey this is adult, i should just
    stay away". NOT ANYMORE I CAN FINALLY DO IT but it still feels weird</p>
    <p>I'm also scared of accidentally reposting stuff in main</p>

<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Afternoon/Evening - Cinema and McBurgers</h2>
    <p>So after eating lunch <i>as an adult</i>, I played a bit more of GT:NH (because i'm obsessed now, help.) and then just
    went out! I went to the movies with my sister and the only friend available, DavidVegeta! We went to watch this movie
    called "Los Tigres", some Spanish production. It was nice, not too bad. The seats were akward though, it was the first time I even
    touched that cinema, so having to deal with <i>that</i> was... something.</p>

    <p>After the cinema, at ~9 PM (Take into account my sister and I left at like 4:45 PM. You can tell how annoying buses are from that alone),
    we went to the nearby McDonalds to avoid another bus, and we ate there! It was nice, they sung me happy birthday with the ice cream,
    and we simply had a nice time ^^</p>

    <p>Here are some pictures, taken by my sister on my phone, because hers is... not good.</p>

    <h2>The ride back home</h2>
    <p>After eating, we met up with our Dad, and after a car ride home, leaving David at his place before that, I simply... got undressed,
    and went to bed, finally sleeping and just resting, I really needed it.</p>
</div>

<div class="bodies">
    <h2>Extra</h2>
    <p>So a little extra. Last night (Nov 9th), my sister just kinda<br>
    broke her phone.<br><br>
    So I just kinda gave her my old one? It has a case and everything, and even if it isn't her color, it's free, she can't complain after
    smashing her old one by accident.
    <br><br>So yes, I wanted to say that, because I think it's kinda hilarious.</p>
    <p>No, she didn't lose much data, she had automatic backups on both WhatsApp and Google itself</p>
</div>
<div class="bodies">
    <p>So that's it for now! I know this was a smaller than average blog, but still</p>
    <p>See you next time!</p>
