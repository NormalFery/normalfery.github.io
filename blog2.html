            <h2>AKA: Carnival is at my school!</h2>

            <p>Hi everyone! Fery back with a 2nd day blog!</p>
            <p>So basically, carnival arrived at my school (and I forgot, of course) and I'm here to talk about all the things that are gonna happen! :3</p>
            <p>First off, well... Costumes! There's a costume contest, like all years, and even one of my classmates decided to dress up! I don't know if he'd win tho, the contest theme was "Music" :/</p>
            <p>Aside from that, my headteacher is gonna participate in a dodgeball contest against other teachers! I'm exited for seeing that. There's also gonna be some sort of theatre stuff that all tech department teachers are gonna participate in, I am really excited for that as well.</p>
            <p>Now, aside from that, in other news : </p>
            <p>I'll most likely be the one to gay the new mob, the Breeze in Pridepack! (And yes, that includes wind charges)</p>
            <p>That does mean however, I have to wait until Mine-imator updates to 1.21, which will happen way after Minecraft updates to 1.21, like, a long time. And yes, Mine-imator is a requirement, I only work with it to preview models</p>
            <p>Like really, look at these dev screenshots for the Pride-xolotls!</p>

            <p>It's all in Mine-imator! Nothing else (aside from Paint Tool SAI 2 for sprite editing)</p>
            <p>So yeah, there's the blog for today! See you guys next time!</p>
